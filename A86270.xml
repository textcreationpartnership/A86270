            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Nor is the expoſing theſe Sermons to publique view intended to add to the maſs of any mans do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor or Internal Regret, for the violent death of the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Author; but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the fictitious <hi>Chimae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra's</hi> of many crazy brains, that would ſhroud them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under his Name,

            <p>They were the laſt that he pronounced in a Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit; therefore ſhould be entertained with more zeal, and read with more circumſpection: that God may be praiſed, his ſervant admired, your ſouls bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited, and our Holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church lamented for the death of ſo pious a Son of hers; whoſe loſs no pen can pourtray with its ſable colours, nor tongue expreſs by all its diapred variety. But ſince it is the will of the Almighty to permit ſuch things for our
<pb facs="tcp:170357:6"/> correction and amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, let us with a pious ſilence reſign our ſelves up unto God (according to the advice of this renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Clergy-man in his laſt words) and pray for a more comely <hi>decorum</hi> in the Church, that ſo the coeleſtial Manna of Gods Word, may be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred to us by the truly-Orthodox; that the Queen of Sciences, Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, may not be ſo ſlut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſhly attired, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poars too often ſhe is, to our intolerable grief; that
<pb facs="tcp:170357:6"/> men may no longer ſhun the beauty of the Church, but dwell in Gods Holy Temple.</p>
            <p>One thing may not be omitted, and that is this: when the Library of this famous Divine was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed, on ſome of his writings there was found engraven with his own pen, theſe words;<note place="margin">Luk. 18.13.</note>

                     <hi>In the Goſpel according to St.</hi> Luke, <hi>Chap. 15. verſ. 7. it is thus written:</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>I ſay unto you, that likewiſe joy ſhall be in heaven over one ſinner that repenteth, more then over ninety and nine just perſons, that need no repentance.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>O man can be ſo ſordid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blockiſh,<note place="margin">SERM. I.</note> or ſo wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly profane, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the neceſſity and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of Repentance: Nor can there be any that plead a right to the title of Chriſtians, but will acknowledge themſelves ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plunged into Sin, as, without Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, they deſerve to be wrapt up in the embraces of eternal flames. This is the ſtable foundation upon which the ſolid Chriſtian builds the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Fabrick of his future felicity.
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170357:11"/> There is a <hi>procul O procul it o profane!</hi> written upon the gates of heaven, unleſs Repentance procure you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance. Since, therefore, Beloved, 'tis ſo neceſſary a Chriſtian duty, I have made choice of this Text; wherein (not to ſtand upon Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, for we have too many of them already) there are Two Parts preſent themſelves to your Meditation.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That there is joy in heaven for the ſouls of the juſt that are already converted; as appears by that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> or <hi>quam, then,</hi> that hath reference to ſomewhat preceding.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That there is far more joy in heaven for the converſion of a peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent ſinner.</p>
            <p>This ſecond in Order, though firſt placed in the Verſe, ſhall be the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of our enſuing Diſcourſe. We muſt therefore conſider,
<list>
                  <item>1. What Repentance is: and</item>
                  <item>2. How to become true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. What it is: and that you ſhall know by this enſuing Definition: <hi>'Tis a new Creation, or ſacred Metamorphoſis of the ſoul, converting it from ſin to God.</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:170357:11"/> The Greek word is very emphatical, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which imports as much as a recollecting of the minde, and meditating as it were upon for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer offences, ſo as to repent and be heartily ſorry for them; not with a ſuperficial and ſlight kinde of grief, but a real, cordial, and extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Compunction and Contrition for ſin.</p>
            <p>Now this Repentance preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſome ſin formerly committed, ſome crime heretofore perpetrated. That we are all infected with the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie of ſin, no rational Chriſtian I preſume will deny, or dare gainſay. Our firſt parents have infuſed, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther left a taint of their firſt ſin upon all their poſterity; ſo that no man, how devout ſoever he be, can plead a freedom from Original corruption: <hi>Nemo non inficitur Adami labe:</hi> All perſons are infected with the ſin of our firſt parents; and, as thorow a chanel, the tincture of it hath taken its courſe to the whole world. You may as well ſeparate <hi>hic homo,</hi> and <hi>hoc individuum,</hi> as Man and Original ſin. Beſides this, how is our life made up
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:170357:12"/> of an infinite number of offences and treſpaſſes! 'Tis but a <hi>faſciculus</hi> or <hi>forrago peccatorum,</hi> a Bundle or Miſce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lany of ſin: ſins Original, and ſins Actual; ſins of Omiſſion, and ſins of Commiſſion; ſins of ignorance, and ſins of Knowledge; ſins againſt the Law of God, and ſins againſt his Goſpel; ſins againſt Light, and ſins againſt Love. Our ſinful Words are more then word can expreſs; our ſinful Thoughts are more then thought can conceive: our ſinful Deeds have been ſo many in number, and ſo hainous in nature, that we have ſcarce left number for more, or place for worſe. Nay, the very Heathens, though poyſoned with I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolatry, and guided by no other light but the Ruſh-candle of Nature, could cry out, <hi>Nemo ſine crimine vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vit:</hi> All men ſin. Since therefore we are all more or leſs vitious, all more or leſs <hi>peccato dediti;</hi> ſince we are all ſick of this diſeaſe of ſin, all troubled with this malady; we muſt ſeek out a Phyſician that may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe us a Medicine, a Cure for this our filthy Leproſie. The Phyſician
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170357:12"/> is our Saviour JESUS; and ſo much is intimated unto us by his Name in the Original, <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, which hath its derivation from <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to heal, and <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> to ſave: firſt he heals, and then he ſaves: firſt he remedies the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of the body, and then he ſaves the ſoul. And that you may be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>excuſable if you ſplit the precious veſſels of your ſouls upon the rock of Perdition; and without defence, that you may not pretend either a ſinful Baſhfulneſs, or Inſufficiencie and Unworthineſs; He himſelf hath vouchſafed to deſcend ſo far below himſelf, as to give you invitation, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11.28. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavie laden, and I will eaſe you.</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, it is in the Original; <hi>all ye that groan under the weight of ſin,</hi> as Porters do under a heavie burthen; <hi>and I will eaſe you,</hi> ſaith our Saviour. So that whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he be that groans under the weight of ſin, and lies under the wrack of a pricking Conſcience, may come, unleſs he be wilfully bent upon his own ruine, and receive help from the Prince of Phyſicians, and the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170357:13"/> God of them too. For he is <hi>the Lamb of God, that taketh away the ſins of the world,</hi> as that pious Anagram of his bleſſed Name doth intimate unto us; <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>: <hi>Thou art the Lamb,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the irreprehenſible Lamb, or Lamb without ſpot or blemiſh: but the Original ſignifies ſomewhat more; ſo undefiled, and ſo pure, that <hi>Momus</hi> himſelf cannot tell how to carp at him. Nay, the bleſſed Angels, Heaven it ſelf rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth at the converſion of a penitent ſinner; Repentance therefore is a thing neceſſary and requiſite to the ſalvation of a ſoul. Chriſt is our Phyſician, and Repentance is our Phyſick. We may ſoon, with the tears of ſincere Contrition, waſh our ſelves in the bloud of Chriſt, from all putrefaction and filthineſs that ſin hath polluted us withal. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ought all of us to begin and take a Leſſon of Repentance in the School of Chriſt: we ought to begin <hi>ab incunabulis,</hi> in our very youth; and not <hi>dare florem diabolo, foecem Deo;</hi> not waſte away the flower and vigour of our youthful years in the devils vaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalage,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170357:13"/> and when our heads are hoa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and Periwig'd with the Snow of Age, then to conſecrate our ſelves to the ſervice of God, and to offer up our ſelves to the Altar of his Acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptance, and that he would for the merits of our moſt bleſſed Saviour, his moſt bleſſed Son, who ſuffered that curſed and ignominious death, the death of the Croſs, for our ſins, have mercy upon us, and pardon all our enormities paſt, preſent and to come. Begin in <hi>May,</hi> not in <hi>Decem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber:</hi> for aſſure your ſelves, God will never accept of the devils leavings. You muſt not ſtream out your Youth in Wine, and live a Lapling to the Silk and Dainties; wear all your Mannors on your back at once, and like the rich man in the Goſpel, go <hi>attired in purple, and fare deliciouſly eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day;</hi> and then think when you are come to the Spectacle, and bearing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaff, to turn to God, and ſteer the Veſſel of your ſoul toward heaven. <hi>Sera poenitentia raro vera:</hi> Repentance in the declining of a mans age, when the Sun of his life is poſting to the Weſt, is ſeldom true. The Thief
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170357:14"/> upon the Croſs, of whom we may truly ſay, <hi>Periiſſet, niſi periiſſet,</hi> was ſav'd: There was <hi>one</hi> ſav'd, that none might deſpair; and <hi>but one,</hi> that none might preſume.</p>
            <p>Uſe not the common Shift of the world, to ſay that you are not guilty of any Crying ſins; they are but pet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty offences. For I muſt tell you, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, theſe are but diabolical ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions infuſed into you by the ſpirit of Darkneſs: you muſt firſt finde out a ſmall God, before you can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a ſmall ſin. Nay, all ſins, of what ſort ſoever they be, are great ſins, ſins of a high ſtature, becauſe commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the Law of the ſin-deteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God. For were it not for the Law of God, that ſtrictly and ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prohibits all manner of ſin, and commands uprightneſs, there would be no ſuch thing in the world as Sin: for what is ſin, but the tranſgreſſion of Gods Law? And therefore holy <hi>David</hi> acknowledged his ſins to be committed againſt God, becauſe he had tranſgreſſed &amp; violated his Law and Commandment: which made him to break forth into that peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170357:14"/> and holy Rapture; <hi>Against thee, against thee onely have I ſinned:</hi> Pſal. 51.4. We are all naturally ſinful: there is no difference by Nature, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Elect and Reprobate, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in external nor internal diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, until it be made by Grace. St. <hi>Paul</hi> was a Perſecutor of as deep a Scarlet-dye, as ever <hi>Domitian</hi> or <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> was: <hi>Zacheus,</hi> as unconſcionable and miſerable a Worldling, as the rich Glutton in the Goſpel, <hi>Luke</hi> 16.19. All perſons are alike by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, till Grace comes in and makes a difference: for we are all by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture children of wrath, heirs of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and in danger of damnation. 'Tis Regeneration, that procures us our paſſage to heaven: <hi>Except a man be re-born,</hi> (or <hi>born anew) he cannot ſee the kingdom of God:</hi> Joh. 3. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.5. <hi>Except ye repent, ye ſhall all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe periſh.</hi> So that ſo long as we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the ſtate of Nature, being conceived in ſin, and brought forth in iniquity, we are ſtill remaining in a moſt deſperate and damnable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>For the poyſon of our Nature is
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170357:15"/> as virulent in us, as in the wicked; and by Nature we are as much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to all manner of ſins: And though by the ſpecial mercy of the Father of mercies, we have eſcaped many damnable and deteſtable crimes, which we finde the wicked have been often implunged into; 'tis not becauſe we are of a more pure and undefiled nature then they, (for 'tis the ſame as theirs) but becauſe the envenom'd virulencie thereof hath not as yet manifeſted it ſelf in us; which we have juſt cauſe every day to fear: for, in truth, we have taken ſo much of the devils <hi>Opium,</hi> that, without Repentance, we ſhall never be awakened out of the dead ſleep of ſin.</p>
            <p>Therefore let us ſtrive with a holy reſolution to ſhake off theſe rags of Natural Corruption, and clothe out ſelves with the precious garment of Chriſt Jeſus. Let us get into a ſtate of grace, and by a real &amp; ſincere Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance turn over a new leaf, become converts &amp; diſciples of our Saviour. <hi>Adam,</hi> you know, did not fall as a private man, but as the Root of all
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170357:15"/> Mankinde; and we all partake of that Fall, ſince we are the iſſue of his loyns: and the veſſels of our bodies ſtill keep a ſmack of the old reliſh. For, according to the Poet,
<q>
                  <l>Quo ſemel est imbuta recens ſervabit odorem,</l>
                  <l>Testa diu.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The ſweeteſt Stream that flows, will reliſh of the ſoyl that it hath ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted.</p>
            <q>Inficitur terrae ſordibus unda fluens.</q>
            <p>Sheep never come neer a hedge, but they leave ſome Wool behinde them. One man infected with the Plague, will corrupt ten men, ſooner then ten men can cure one infected perſon. You know what the Saty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt ſaith:
<q>
                  <l>—Grex totus in agris,</l>
                  <l>Unius ſcabie cadit, &amp; porrigine porci.</l>
               </q> Which our Engliſh Proverb renders exactly, <hi>One ſcabbed ſheep will ſpoil the whole flock.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="12" facs="tcp:170357:16"/>
            <p>Well might that ſweet-mouth'd Romane call this <hi>The Iron Age:</hi> for Iniquity is an epidemical diſtemper, or a Chronical Diſeaſe, that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of no Cure but Repentance, and that ſincere too. And I fear that the Poet writ in Prophetick meaſures, when his Muſe warbled this ſo ſuitable an expreſſion to our Times:
<q>
                  <l>Nil erit ulterius, quod nostris moribus addat</l>
                  <l>Poſteritas.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>Our Age is grown to ſuch a height of Impiety, that Poſterity will not be able to adde any thing to it. Pride ſwaggers in the ſtreets, Luxury is houſed, and Drunkenneſs reels to and fro, notwithſtanding the heavie Judgements of God denounced a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thoſe that exerciſe ſuch abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations: and all the Armour of the mightieſt Potentates in the world is not able to reſiſt the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets of God, when their Commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſeal'd with God's <hi>Ipſe dixit, cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jus verbum ab intentione, quia veritas,
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170357:16"/> factum a verbo, quia virtus, non dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fert.</hi> Gods word is a word with a deed; and what he ſaith, ſhall be done without doubt or demur: And all good men will obey his Law and Commandment: but where are theſe good men now adays? A good man is hard to be found; he is <hi>rara avis in terris,</hi> ſprung from the aſhes of ſome dead Phoenix, whoſe abode is ſcarce known: he is like the Berries of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah</hi>'s tree, here and there one to be found: nay, 'tis a thouſand to one, if you finde one in a thouſand. The jerk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Satyriſt, the Laſh of his time, could ſay, ſo long ſince, much more then may we now,
<q>
                  <l>Rari quippe boni, numero vix ſunt to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidem, quot</l>
                  <l>Thebarum portae vel divitis ostia Nili.</l>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>There are but ſeven good men, at moſt, ſaith he. A ſmall number in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! What the Philoſopher ſaith of Good, I'm ſure is in theſe our Times verified of Evil: <hi>Malum est
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170357:17"/> ſui diffuſivum:</hi> Evil is diffuſive; 'tis of a ſpreading nature; a diſeaſe that is catching; therefore we ſhould never go abroad without an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dote againſt it; and that is the Word of God: for, <hi>Antidotum verbi ſerpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis venenum expugnat:</hi> The Word of God is a ſoveraign Antidote againſt the poyſon of the Serpent. We live now in the ſink of Time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Vertue is accounted a Prodigie, and Piety a Crime, or at the beſt a Simplicity. And our <hi>Aarons</hi> are taken away, and put aſide as uſeleſs; and the people die of the Plague: I wonder who ſhall ſtand between the living and the dead, holding the Cenſers, and making Atonement for them?

If the Evangeliſts in their time could cry out, Repent, repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand; it muſt of neceſſity be nearer at hand now then it was then; therefore beloved, I have the more cauſe to preſs this Doctrine of repentance upon you: and let me tell you, that there is no muſick ſo melodious in the ears of God, as that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſounds from a broken inſtrument: God loves a broken heart, and yet he'll have the whole heart or none: 'tis ſtrange, and yet true, repentance is a conſumption, yet no ſickneſs; and what man would not willingly condeſcend to undergo ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption here, that he might not be conſumed in endleſs, eaſeleſs and remedileſs flames and torments here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after?

            <p>Such haughty minds are not ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd aright; they have no true frame of a penitent ſpirit; neither will God accept of ſuch perſons: and till you be reconciled to God through his ſon Jeſus Chriſt, and are waſhed and cleanſed from all your iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties by the tears of repentance, and be converted from ſin to God, your caſe is deſperate; and it had been better for you to have been a beaſt, than a man. Diſplay your ſins before God, not hypocritically, but real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; for there is no diſſembling with God: and confeſſion in your mouth, if it be hypocritical, will be like a <hi>Shibboleth</hi> in the Hebrew; you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pronounce it without liſping: your ſins are hainous, confeſs them cordially to be ſo; your ſins are many in number, acknowledg them to be ſo; the <hi>Terra incognita</hi> of your corruptions is far larger then the <hi>Terra cognita.</hi> But let not the hai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouſneſs of thy ſin, the number or multitude of them, deter thee from repentance; but proceed with a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolution to go through all diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties by the help of Chriſt Jeſus,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170357:23"/> and all objections that the world, the fleſh, and the devil can alleadge againſt you, till you have obtained pardon and remiſſion of your ſins: never ceaſe, till you come to a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod; for he that intends to ſing <hi>Te Deum</hi> to the Almighty, muſt not break off till he come to the end. Proceed, I ſay, beloved, <hi>ad finem uſque,</hi> and rely upon the merits of our Jeſus: and be not put off by the hainouſneſs of your ſins, and the rigour of the Law of God; for if the moſt holy man that ever breath'd upon the face of the earth, ſhould be weighed in the balance of the Sanctuary, and no grain of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour be allowed him, then without all doubt <hi>mene tekel</hi> might be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to him, he would be found too light. There will be grains of allowance to thee, without queſtion; therefore be converted, and turn from the broad way of ſin and death, to the narrow path of life and eternal glory; for ſuch a ſoul will be acceptable unto the Lord; the bleſſed Quire of Angels will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce at the converſion of ſuch a

            <p n="1">1. The firſt ſtep whereof that leads and conducts to heaven, is for a man to have an internal regret for ſin, to be grieved and perplexed for it, to be wounded in conſcience for it; for till a man ſee his Sins in the glaſs of repentance, and weigh them, and meditate upon the curſe of God that hangs over his head in a judgment for them, he will never repent: This is the <hi>godly ſorrow that leadeth unto repentance never to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of.</hi> This compunction or pricking of the heart is a clear de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration of repentance, ſincere and ſound; and is the firſt ſtep to

            <p>And if it be ſo that this is the firſt ſtep to heaven; <label type="milestone">

Now apply this to your ſelves, Beloved; did the ſacrificing Knife of Gods Word never wound your conſcience, nor extract one tear from your eyes for the deluge of your Sins, that will overwhelm your ſoul eternally, without Gods infinite mercy? if you have not been thus and thus grieved for your treſpaſſes and tranſgreſſions, you are in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperate condition, and there is very little hope or probability of your ſalvation.</p>

            <p n="2">2. The ſecond ſign of, or way to true penitency, is this, when a man fears to Sin, not becauſe of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment, but becauſe he offends ſo
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:170357:32"/> great a God in ſo doing: like holy <hi>Joſeph,</hi> who when he was tempted by the ſweet careſſes of his Miſtris, cried out, <hi>How can I do this great evil, and ſin againſt God!</hi> Therefore from him we may learn what is moſt to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired here on earth, <hi>viz.</hi> the love and favour of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo that if any one ſhould put the queſtion to you, and demand what your deſire moſt hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted after, and what your affections were moſt fixed on? You ought to anſwer, The love and favour of God in Chriſt Jeſus. 'Tis not your em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidered apparel, your manners and mannors, your parts and arts, that are able to appeaſe the trouble and perplexity of a diſtreſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; nothing but the mercy of God in Chriſt Jeſus will afford it: This is the onely refuge for a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled conſcience in the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamity. Men may in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities go to drink away ſorrow, as they term it in their profane gib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briſh, and betake themſelves to their merry company; but alas! this is no comfort, this no remedy for their diſeaſe: an old ſore gangren'd or
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170357:33"/> putrified, if it be not very skilfully handled, will hardly admit of cure; but if it be ſuperficially healed at top, and not throughly at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, as ſoon as 'tis skin'd at the top, it will break out at the bottom; ſo when men ſeek to ſmother the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of their own conſciences, and ſtrive to blunt the edge of it, it will rebound again, and give a deadly wound, even to deſperation. Beg of God therefore power and ability through his ſtrengthning grace, that you may be buoy'd up thereby in the midſt of an Ocean of troubles, and that the burden of an afflicted wounded conſcience may be mino<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, and leſſened, that ſo you may not fall into deſpair. To prevent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, all godly perſons ought like <hi>Heraclitus,</hi> to weep away their daies; and indeed, they are a ſea of tears, a meer vapour melted into tears: his voice is painted with tears, which have ſuch an airy power and faculty, as that they are able to mount up to Heaven, and there to inſinuate themſelves into the ear of the Almighty, begging and craving
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:170357:33"/> pardon for ſin, and a preſervation from deſpair by the mighty power of God. <hi>Lachrymae &amp; preces</hi> are the only weapons in a Chriſtian battel; let us ſo fight with theſe weapons, as to get the peace of conſcience and joy of the Holy Ghoſt, that paſſeth all underſtanding, and that ſpeedily too: for our journey is long, and our time ſhort, therefore we had need to husband it well: Can there be a longer journey then from earth to heaven? and a ſhorter time than a moment? Yet ſuch is our journey, ſuch is our time: Repent therefore now while it is called to day, harden not your hearts, for <hi>procrastination</hi> is dangerous: doubt not of the power of God, for he is Omnipotent; and this attribute of his is manifeſted in every petty piece of the Hexame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron Fabrick: There is <gap reason="foreign">

            <p n="3">3. The third ſtep to true repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, is a conſtant and ſetled reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, never to ſin, or diſpleaſe God; to do his will, walk in the way of his Commandments: I do not ſay, that a truly ſanctified perſon never ſins at all, but he never ſins with an intent and purpoſe to ſin; he takes no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light or complacency in ſin; 'tis the ſole object of his hatred, and reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth to pleaſe God as far as poſſibly he may by the grace of God that ſtrengthens him: When he can ſay with holy <hi>David, Pſalm</hi> the 18. and the 23. <hi>I have refrained my feet from every evil way.</hi> Again, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. <hi>He that is born of God ſinneth not, i. e.</hi> not with a full purpoſe of heart, or with a delight in it, or affection to it; but they conſtantly ſtrive againſt it, ſhun and avoid the occaſions of ſin, ſuſpect themſelves upon every occaſion, and are continually arm'd to give battel to the devil and his temptations. <hi>In may things we ſin all,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James.</hi> But if we can but ſay really and experimentally that it is againſt our intention, that we hate,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170357:34"/> abhor &amp; deteſt ſin with an unuttera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble hatred, and that we condemn the very ſins we commit, then we may be comforted, receive joy, and aſſure our ſelves that we are true peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents; for this takes away the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of ſin in our mortal bodies: doth not quite thruſt it out, it doth deveſt it of its authority; ſo that it hath no power to prejudice or injure us in our ſalvation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The fourth ſign of, or way un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to true repentance, is an aggravation of our ſins; when we render them hainous in the ſight of God, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging we have ſinned ſo much, that we deſerve eternal dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; we deſerve that the Vials of Gods wrath ſhould be poured down upon our heads.

               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:170357:35"/>5.

            <p>We muſt ſo confeſs our ſins, as to beg pardon for them, and to entreat the Lord to have pity on us out of the bowels of his tender compaſſion.

Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of ſins is the forerunner of remiſſion; and this muſt not be flaſhy and for a time, but ſo long as are our years upon the earth mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured out; for he that will ſerve the <hi>primus motor,</hi> muſt not write his <hi>ne ultra,</hi> till he come to the <hi>Terminus ad quem.</hi> He muſt proceed with a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; we muſt confeſs them openly, and not like the worldly wiſe, whoſe wiſdom <hi>Lactantius</hi> ſaith, <hi>abſcondit, non abſcindit peccata;</hi> conceals, and not cuts aſunder, or ſeparates ſin.

            <p n="2">2.

Love is to our ſouls, as weight is to ponderous bodies; for as the gravity of a body forceth it down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, that it may enjoy a ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in its centre; ſo Love moves our ſouls to an object that promiſeth repoſe and contentment; therefore from hence it follows, that as ponde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous bodies move in a ſtraight line toward their centre: ſo if we will obtain a true reſt, our Love muſt be regular, and proceed in a direct

            <p>This Text, Beloved, that I come from reading to you, is the Epitome of Chriſtian Religion; or the great <hi>Folio</hi> of Chriſtian duty, reduced into a <hi>Decimo-ſexto,</hi> or pocket-volume.</p>
            <p>In this Text there are two parts; and theſe two parts are the two pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of the Church, and the whole Chriſtian World.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Our love toward God, in theſe words, <hi>We love him;</hi>

               </gap>.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Gods love toward us, which is but the reaſon, or rather efficient cauſe of our love toward him; <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he firſt loved us,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>.</p>
            <p>Not to ſtand upon the nice and fine-ſpun diſtinctions that the School-men make of Love, we ſhall only divide it into two ſorts; <hi>Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num</hi> and <hi>Humanum amorem;</hi> into Love Divine, and Humane: the divine is couched down by the holy Spirit of God in the latter part of the verſe, <hi>becauſe he loved us;</hi> and the humane in the former, <hi>We love him.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="57" facs="tcp:170357:38"/>
            <p>We will begin with the latter, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane love, or the love of man to God.</p>
            <p>Spiritual, or true love, gives repoſe and contentment to the ſoul; when as carnal or falſe love is an irregular agitation, and an inconſiderate mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without a <hi>Terminus ad quem.</hi> it is ever repleat with <hi>inquietude</hi> and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraction; and never ceaſeth or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth, till it deſpairs, or is quite ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red out; which is not properly a reſt, but an impotency and inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of motion; and the deſire is ſtrong when the power is weak, like a horſe that tied to a manger gnaweth his bridle aſunder: ſuch are moſt perſons; their deſires are ſtrong, their power but weak; they deſire moſt what they can leaſt perform.</p>
            <p>The cauſe of this diſturbance is this: Our Love ſelecteth out,<note place="margin">
                  <p>Reaſons why we love not God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly.</p>
                  <p n="1">1 Cauſe.</p>
               </note> and fixeth upon falſe objects, and ſuch that cannot ſatiate the deſire; for if you ſurvey all ſublunary things that deſerve the name of beautiful, you ſhall find in them no true quiet or reſt, but a concatenation of cares, interwoven with perpetual trouble.
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170357:39"/> The greateſt delicacies are conſited in bitterneſs. The acquiſition of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and preferment is painful; and many break their necks in riding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the airy ſtilts of Fame. The poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of riches is uncertain, and the loſs certain; if they leave not us by ſome accident, Death (Natures Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liff) will arreſt us, and force us to leave them. To aim at ſuch things is but <hi>ventum proſequi,</hi> To purſue the wind; an action as ridiculous as can be.</p>
            <p>Grant they be good, yet they are incertain; therefore we muſt ſeek after our repoſe ſomewhere elſe, ſince the earth cannot afford it, and turn the compaſs of our Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Heaven. For as the lower re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the Air is the habitation of winds, tempeſts, and earth-quakes; but that part that is near the Heaven is ſerene and quiet: ſo our Love, ſo long as it adheres to ſublunary ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, will be full of trouble, but 'twill find reſt and quiet, if it lift it ſelf up to Heaven, and lay hold of the promiſes of God: and then the ſoul, though in the midſt of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170357:39"/> and afflictions of this world, be they never ſo thorny, will have the fruition of an aſſured tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: like the Needle of the Compaſs that remains firm upon one point, notwithſtanding the violence of the ſcolding ſurges of a Tempeſtuous Sea; and all becauſe it is guided by the motion of the Heavens. God is the ſole object (or at leaſt ought to be) of our Love, and hath only a power to render us amiable by lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving us; He that only can, nay that will give them felicity, and that un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utterable too, that love him. As the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> writeth, in the firſt to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> the 2 Chap. and the 9 verſ. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath entred into the heart of man to conceive, the things that God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> He promiſeth alſo in St. <hi>John,</hi> chap. 14. verſ. 23. <hi>to come unto him</hi> that loveth him, <hi>and make his abode with him.</hi> O unparallelled Love! that makes a Palace of our ſouls for the King of Glory, and a Sanctuary of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">2 Cauſe.</note> Philoſophy it ſelf hath this
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170357:40"/> down for a maxime, that <hi>Natura &amp; Deus nihil fecerunt fruſtra,</hi> that God and Nature made nothing in vain. Now that infinite and inſatiable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire or appetite that is in man, were in vain, if there were nothing to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie and content it; Which ſince it is impoſſible to find out upon this Terraqueous Globe, we muſt ſearch after it in Heaven, of God that is <hi>bonum infinitum,</hi> an infinite good.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <note place="margin">3 Cauſe.</note>3. Beſides, God created the world for the uſe of man, and therefore without doubt he created man for ſomething better then the world, <hi>viz.</hi> God himſelf.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <note place="margin">4 Cauſe.</note>4. God created man <hi>inter omnia animalia,</hi> only <hi>ſecundum imaginem,</hi> according to his own image, with a ſtraight body, and an upright coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, according to mellifluous <hi>Naſo,</hi>

               </q> that ſo he might behold him, whom
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170357:40"/> he repreſented; and that the But, and White, of all his actions and thoughts, might be Heaven.</p>
            <p n="5">5.<note place="margin">5 Cauſe.</note> The perfection of our ſpirits cannot be, but in the union of or with the firſt of ſpirits, who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municateth his <hi>bona,</hi> or good things to us his Creatures, as the Sun darts his rays upon us; that is, he gives them ſo, he beſtows them on us, yet ſo, that they depend on him after he hath diſpoſed of them.</p>
            <p n="6">6.<note place="margin">6 Cauſe.</note> True Love is that tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formeth the <hi>amantem</hi> the Lover, in <hi>amatum,</hi> into the thing or party lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Now if a deformed perſon be never ſo highly enamoured with the captivitating beauty of a red &amp; white complexion, he will never be able by this love to correct his deformity. On the contrary, in loving God, we become <hi>ſibi ſimiles,</hi> like unto him; and as the holy Apoſtle ſaith in the ſecond to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> the third Chap. and the laſt verſe, <hi>Beholding as in a glaſs the glory of the Lord, with open face, are changed into the ſame image.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. And laſtly, Beauty,<note place="margin">7 Cauſe.</note> being the firſt incitation to Love, or the Tin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170357:41"/> of the affections, we ſhall ſoon be able to diſcern when the ſcales of ignorance are fallen from our eyes, that this beauty, as we term it, that is here below, is but a ſuperficial co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, or a cover to a bundle of fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs: but that the <hi>Lumen,</hi> or true Light, is the true beauty; God therefore being the true Light, and the Father of Lights, is the chief beauty, and the object on whom we all ought to fix our affections.</p>
            <p>Natural Philoſophy here is dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite to the Divine, and jars with it much in this caſe; for Philoſophy affirms that <hi>Natural motion is better then that is against Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</hi> On the contrary, <hi>quoad amorem,</hi> the Word of God, that is, our Divine Philoſophy, inſtructeth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwadeth us, that <hi>Love contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is better then Love natural.</hi> For ſince that Satan in ſeducing our firſt Parents, hath defaced the image of God in Man, our deſires have had their conſtant courſe towards the World, and, as I may ſay, our Love hath been precipitated from Heaven to the Earth. The <hi>affection of the fleſh
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170357:41"/> is enmity againſt God,</hi> Romans the 8. and the 7 verſe: If one love, that love flows not from him naturally, but it is a free gift of God. And the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> drawing us out of the mud, and freeing us from the bait of all alluring delights of this World, commands us to <hi>ſeek the things above,</hi> Coloſſ. 3. verſ. 1, 2. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, be skilful in the things above, be wiſe in heavenly matters; for according to the words in my Text, <hi>We love God, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Our love therefore it appears ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſtly, is an effect of Gods Love to us; nor is there any thing that we ought with more devotion or zeal to crave of God, then Love; for it is a pledg unto the faithful of Gods Love to him. It is the firſt fruit, the <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiae</hi> of Faith; 'tis the moſt exact and curious extract of the Image of God. It is the moſt perſpicuous mark of a child of God.<note place="margin">Love is the ſumme of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</note> This Love is the ſoul of our ſoul; the life of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; the rule by which we ſquare (or at leaſt ought to do) all our acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; the ſummary or <hi>compendium</hi> of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:170357:42"/> the Law: 'Tis the pillar or <hi>ſuſtenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum</hi> of Martyrs; the <hi>Jacobs</hi> Lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by which you may aſcend the Heavens, and true peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience; nay (with holy reverence be it ſpoken) it is a <hi>praelibamen,</hi> or earneſt-penny of that Sacred union and communion that we expect all to enjoy with God in Heaven, world without end. Our meditation could not pitch upon a more ſublime ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject; for what is there that dare ſtand in competition with God, either for his greatneſs, or the ſweetneſs and candor of his Love? The profit of this Love of God is no way infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior to the delight; for men are ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med good or evil, not for what they believe, but what they love.</p>
            <p>Let us all therefore labour for this, and become proficients in the School of Chriſt, and beſeech the ſpirit ſo to mould our hearts, that they may be wrought to a true and perfect Love of God: leſt we be abuſed and fooled into error with the ſound of this word <hi>Love,</hi> and miſtake the ſpiritual for a carnal love, an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunate or fretting corroſion of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170357:42"/> heart; an aguiſh alteration; the laſt of vices for the firſt and beſt of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, a brutiſh malady for an Ange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical diſtemper.</p>
            <p>'Tis true; he that diſpoſeth and conformeth himſelf to the Love of God, muſt expect the hatred and beſpattering calumnies of the world; but God will cauſe the very diſcom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities that the world afflicts us with, to be converted into commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and profit: for (ſaith the bleſſed Apoſtle) <hi>Rom.</hi> the 8. and the 28. <hi>And we know that all things work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for good to them that love God, to them who are the called, according to his purpoſe.</hi> Their corporeal afflictions, are but ſpiritual exerciſes; their <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, <hi>nocumenta, documen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta.</hi> The malady of their body, is a remedy for their ſoul: for God alone is the true <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> ſo divine a <hi>Chymiſt,</hi> that he will convert poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons into <hi>Antidotes</hi> for his childrens health and ſecurity: His wounds are balm, ſaith the Divine Harper, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 14. verſ. 5. In all our ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings for Gods ſake, there is not only matter of patience, but occaſion for
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170357:43"/> glory; they are ſcars of credit in the forehead; conformities unto our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, and the livery of all Chriſtian Souldiers. And all this by the ſuſtentation and ſupport of this Love, the ſweetneſs whereof qualifies and abates the bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs of all ſublunary croſſes.</p>

               </label> But here ſome may object and ſay, that the Love of God is <hi>pro confeſso</hi> an excellent vertue; but we muſt know him, before we love him; and we cannot compaſs any other but a lame and decrepit inſufficient noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of him. 'Tis true; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, we ought ſtill <hi>dare operam</hi> to it, and make exact ſearch after it; and when we have it, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it; for ignorance muſt not be a Cloak or tegument to our negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, ſince we cannot gain ſo little of the true knowledge of God, but ſome profit will accrue to us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, and that will blow up the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the love of God in us to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable degree of heat and pious zeal. One ray of the love of God will outbalance and overvalue all the ſplendor of the <hi>Meridian</hi> Sun. A

            </p>
            <p>We are ſo incapable of the Love of God, that we underſtand not what it is to love him: This Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge grows not in our Eden; This flower ſprings not up in our Garden; 'tis <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, a gift dropt out of Heaven, proceeding from the Father, who <hi>is Love</hi> and Charity, as St. <hi>John</hi> ſaith: This is a divine liquor, the true Nectar, that God poures into our ſouls <hi>guttatim,</hi> drop by drop, as in narrow-neckt veſſels. Wherefore to accommodate our ſelves to our native ſlowneſs, we'll endeavour to infuſe into our ſpirits by little and little, ſo by degrees to arrive at the higheſt
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:170357:44"/> degree and <hi>Apex</hi> of Love.</p>
            <p>There are five degrees of this our Love to God.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt is, to love God for the good he doth us, and we expect to receive from him ſtill.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, To love him <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter ſeipſum,</hi> or <hi>ſui ipſius gratia,</hi> for his own ſake, becauſe he is moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent, and moſt amiable.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Thirdly, To love God above all things, nay your own ſelves; but to love nothing in the World, but for his ſake.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Fourthly, To deteſt and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hor himſelf for the Love of God.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Fifthly, to love him as we ſhall in the life to come, when we ſhall be in glory; with this love the Saints are extaſied, and aſſiſt at the Throne of God in <hi>ſecula ſeculorum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We call theſe Degrees of Love, and not <hi>ſpecies</hi> or kinds, becauſe the ſuperior contain the inferior, as the chiefeſt white differs from the other parcels of the ſame colour that are leſs clear and tranſparent, not in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> but in <hi>gradu:</hi> we muſt remount up theſe degrees or ſtairs, and reſt
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:170357:44"/> our ſelves a little upon every one of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt degree and loweſt is,<note place="margin">Five de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees by which we are brought to love God.</note> To love God for the good he doth us; upon this ſtep of Love was King <hi>David,</hi> when in the 116 <hi>Pſalm,</hi> and in the 1 verſe, <hi>I love the Lord, becauſe he hath heard my voice, and my ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> and ſo in the 18 <hi>Pſalm:</hi> for God will have reſpect and love from us, becauſe he extends his bounty ſo liberally to us. 'Tis God that crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted us; 'tis God that preſerves and keeps us being created; that nouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheth our bodies, that cheriſheth our ſouls; that redeemeth us by his Son; that governs us by his holy Spirit; that inſtructeth us by his word, that hath vouchſafed to admit us as his ſervants, nay his friends and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; and which is more, the ſame with himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Plato</hi> playing the Philoſopher with the grace of God,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Plato</hi> bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God for three things.</note> thanked him for three things:
<list>
                  <item>1. That he was created a man, and not a beaſt.</item>
                  <item>2. That he was born a <hi>Graecian,</hi> and not a <hi>Barbarian;</hi> and,</item>
                  <pb n="70" facs="tcp:170357:45"/>
                  <item>3. That he was a Philoſopher.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>Now we that are inſtructed in the School of Chriſt, a School of more ſtrict diſcipline,<note place="margin">So ought we for theſe eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially.</note> make another kind of diſtribution of the grace of God, and return him thanks for theſe three things:</p>
            <p n="1">1. That of all Creatures, we were created men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That of all men, Chriſtians; And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. That among thoſe that are Chriſtians, he hath made us in the number of the true elect. And if you pleaſe, you may add a fourth, That he hath adopted us by his Son Jeſus Chriſt, before the foundation of the World; having been carefull of us, not onely before we had any exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, but even before the world had its creation. Now if God did mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt his love to us before we were, how liberally will he extend it to us, how bountifully will it flow from him when we invocate and call upon his Sacred Name, and affect him with a filial and reverential love? Now the ſmaller our number is, the larger is our priviledge; the more
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170357:45"/> extenſive and diffuſive is his bounty and goodneſs to us; to endow us with ſight, among ſo many blind per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; as the portion of <hi>Jacob</hi> in <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> ſolely enlightned in the midſt of obſcurity, Cimmerian darkneſs: like the fleece of <hi>Gideon,</hi> that was only bedewed with the grace of God, when the reſt of the earth was dry, and deſtitute of it. God hath encir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled us with abundance of examples of ſtupendious caecity or blindneſs, that he might raiſe our eſtimation of light, and that we might make a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther progreſs in the way of ſalvation, that ſo whileſt it is called to day, we may ſteer the ſhip of our ſouls by the Lanthorn of his Word. All theſe vertues, the conſtellation of all theſe graces, depend upon one Soveraign and Prime one, <hi>viz.</hi> reconciliation with God by the paſſion of our bleſſed Jeſus. This is the Chanel through which the graces of God ſtream unto us. 'Tis <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder that joyns Heaven and Earth toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that rejoyns God and Man. The Angels aſcending this Ladder, repreſent our prayers, that we pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170357:46"/> dart up to Heaven: the Angels deſcending, ſignifie the bleſſings of God that are diſtilled in anſwer to our prayers. <hi>Jacob</hi> ſleeping at the foot of the Ladder, intimates unto us the quiet and tranquillity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that we enjoy under the cool and comfortable ſhade of his interceſſion. Before, man was envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roned with horror and aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he could not caſt his eye a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, but he met with an object of fear. If he look't upon God, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned a conſuming fire, a ſupream Juſtice, armed with revenge againſt ſinners. If he caſt his eye upon the Law, he immediately perceived the arreſt of condemnation: If he viewed the Heaven, he concluded himſelf excluded thence by reaſon of ſin; If the World, he ſaw his irreparable loſs of dominion over the Creatures; if himſelf, a thouſand ſpiritual and corporal infirmities. At the ſignes of Heaven, and the Earth-quake, he was ague-ſtruck with fear. Then Satan, Death, Hell, were his invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate foes, that either drew him to perdition, or did behel and wrack
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:170357:46"/> him with the expectation of them. But now every perſon that hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in Chriſt Jeſus, changes his language, and ſpeaks in a more pleaſing dialect. If he look upon God, he'll ſay, 'Tis my Father, that hath adopted me: If his thoughts pitch upon the day of Judgement, he'll beſpeak himſelf thus, My El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Brother ſits there; and he that is my Judge, is alſo my Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor: If he think on the Angels, he cries out, They are my guardians, <hi>Pſalm</hi> the 34. If he view the Heaven, he terms it his habitation. If he hear it thunder, he'll reply, 'Tis the voice of my Father. If he conſider the Law, The Son of God (ſaith he) hath accompliſht it for me. If he ſwim with the flowing tide of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity, he'll ſay, God hath reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved better things for me. If in the low ebb of adverſity, Jeſus Chriſt hath endured far more for me. God exerciſeth, or proves, corrects or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicts me, making me therein confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable to his Son. If he thinks on Hell, the Devil, or Death, then he will triumph over all with the holy
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:170357:47"/> Apoſtle; in the 1 to the <hi>Corinth.</hi> the 15 Ch. and the 55, 56, and 57 verſ. <hi>O Death, where is thy ſting! O grave, where is thy victory! The ſting of Death is ſin, and the ſtrength of ſin is the Law: But thanks be to God, which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Though theſe things buz about his ears like bees provoked or irritated, yet they have loſt their ſting. If the old ſerpent bruiſe his heel, yet his head is broken; if the Devil give us a falſe alarm by perſecutions, yet we are ſouldiers fighting under Chriſts Banner, liſted and regiſtred into the Book of Life at our Baptiſm: he hath bought and redeemed us by his moſt precious blood, and no one can raviſh us from him. What ſoul can be ſo ſordid as to fear the arm of fleſh, when he is guarded by the ſpirit of Chriſt, that doth not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intercede for ſinners, but of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners makes them become juſt: That is not only Advocate of a bad cauſe, but alſo renders it good; That doth both pray, and pay for us; ſo that his pardoning of us is not onely a work of his mercy, but alſo an effect
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170357:47"/> of his juſtice? Beſides theſe obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we have an infinite number of incitations to the love of Chriſt, if we will but recollect our ſelves, and ſeriouſly conſider, how often he hath delivered us from imminent danger; cauſed inexpected overtures of evil intended to us, that we might avoid them: for according to the old Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, <hi>Praemoniti, praemuniti,</hi> forewar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, forearmed; and afflicted us here, that he might ſave us hereafter. Now 'twas the wiſh of that famous pillar of the Latin Church St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin, Hic ure, hic tunde, hic ſeca, modo in aeternum parcas:</hi> Cut, ſaw, burn my body here, ſo thou ſaveſt my ſoul hereafter. Now for ſhame, let it not be ſaid, that God hath ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red down his bleſſings on the ſand. Let us not be ſo beſtial, as to drink of the ſtream, and ne'er think of the fountain; without elevating our thoughts unto God the ſource of all benedictions.</p>
            <p>But when we ſay God doth good unto us, to the end that we may love him; not that he ſtands in need of our Love, but he will have us love
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:170357:48"/> him, in regard that we cannot be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved if we hate him. Nay farther, that we love him, proceeds from him as a gift; for 'tis he that kindles in us his love. He doth not only beſtow and confer his <hi>bona</hi> upon us, but he gives us a hand to receive them, grace to uſe them, and vertue to glorifie for them; ſo that <hi>Deus primo dat quod jubet,</hi> and then <hi>jubet quod vult:</hi> firſt he gives what he commands, <hi>viz.</hi> Love,<note place="margin">Love is the gift of God.</note> and then he commands what is moſt agreable to his will and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
            <p>This firſt degree or ſtep of Love, though it be holy and uſeful, yet 'tis but <hi>principium amoris divini,</hi> 'tis but the prologue to the Love of God; for he that loves God only for profit, is like an infant or child that prays only for his break-faſt; and to ſpeak properly, ſuch perſons love not God, but themſelves. Such love is but mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenary, and injurious to God, a pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable affront put upon the Deity. Therefore he muſt know, that hath gained this firſt degree, he muſt proceed; for <hi>non progredi, eſt regredi;</hi> to be at a ſtand, is to be retrograde:
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170357:48"/> he muſt therefore, I ſay, aſcend the ſecond ſtep.</p>
            <p>The ſecond degree of our Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, is to Love him,<note place="margin">2 Degree.</note> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for our profit, but alſo for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> laying aſide all conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of his benefits, that he is dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pleaſed to confer on us; and though we expected no profit from him, yet to love him <hi>ſupra omnia.</hi> Holy <hi>David</hi> ſpake of this Love in the 69 Pſalm, <hi>Let all thoſe that love thee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in thy name.</hi> He counſels us to love God for his name, becauſe he is the ſupream, Wiſe in his counſel, juſt in his actions, true in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; whoſe habitation is in glory inacceſſible; enjoying a Soveraign perfection. God, whoſe life was without beginning, and his duration without end; his eternity without alteration, his greatneſs without meaſure, and his power irreſiſtible: That created the World by his Word, governs it by his vertue, and will reduce it to a Chaos of ruine, when it is his pleaſure: Who in one ſole vertue and perfection, which is his Eſſence, encompaſſeth all other
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170357:49"/> vertues that are infuſed into all other creatures. All other vertues do con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centre in this <hi>punctum;</hi> and the more they deviate from him, the more ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centrique they are. God therefore is to be loved for theſe preceding con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations, more then for the good that he is pleaſed to confer upon us. Our Saviour inſtructeth us the ſame, in that moſt abſolute pattern, that he himſelf hath ſet before us; in which he commands to beg <hi>the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification of his Holy Name,</hi> and <hi>the advancement of his Kingdom;</hi> before we put up a petition for our <hi>daily bread.</hi> We naturally are enamoured with beauty: now Light is the firſt of beauties, without which there is no diſtinction between beauty and deformity. God therefore being the <hi>primum lumen,</hi> it follows neceſſarily that he be alſo the prime beauty. He is the Father of Lights, <hi>Pater Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>James;</hi> and holy <hi>David</hi> the Pſalmiſt in the 36 <hi>Pſalm</hi> 9. <hi>For with thee is the Fountain of Life; in thy light ſhall we ſee light.</hi> Wherefore in laying his hand to the ſtately Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brick of the World, when he redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170357:49"/> the Chaos of confuſion into a beautiful and harmonious order, he began firſt with the light, as that by which his nature is beſt repreſented. He is the <hi>Sun of Righteouſneſs,</hi> a Sun that never comes to the Weſt, never ſets, nor caſts a ſhadow; <hi>all things are naked unto him, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, all things are bare-neckt unto him,</hi> 'tis in the Original, being a metaphor taken from the <hi>mode</hi> in the Eaſtern Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys, where they go bare-neckt: ſuch a Sun as doth not only clarifie the ſight, but gives it alſo. And judge you what a ſplendid, ſight-of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending luſtre this is, that the <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims</hi> aſſiſting at his Throne cover their faces with their wings, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, 6 Chap. 2 verſ. not being able to endure ſo glorious a ſplendor. And if at the coming and appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the humanity of Chriſt, the Sun ſhall be benegroed in darkneſs, as a petty light at the coming of a greater; how, if you caſt an eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the life of God!<note place="margin">The life of God.</note> ours is but a ſhadow, if compared to it, nay a <hi>nihil:</hi> for our life is a flux or ſucceſſion of parts. But God poſſeſſeth and
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:170357:50"/> hath full and entire fruition of his <hi>eadem inſtanti,</hi> and all together. And his only begotten Son was willing to lay down his life for the redemption of us miſerable and wretched ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: That Son that <hi>Iſaiah</hi> calls Chap. the 9. <hi>Father of eternity,</hi> was content to aſſume this frail fleſh of ours. He became Son of Man, that we might become the ſons of God. He was born in a ſtable, that we might be received into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven; born among beaſts, that we might be the aſſociates of Angels. He that was <hi>regens ſydera,</hi> became <hi>ſugens ubera;</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>. He that is the bread of life was pinched with hunger, that we might be ſatisfied. He that is the fountain of life, became thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, that we might have ours quench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. In fine, he that is life it ſelf, did undergo death, that he might make us heirs of eternal life. <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, as the bleſſed Apoſtle in a holy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſie cried out; <hi>O the depth of the riches of the Love of Chriſt!</hi> Theſe are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſundities that ſwallow up our ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and there is pleaſure in being
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:170357:50"/> loſt therein: for theſe are the graces of God that ſurpaſſe our ſhallow capacities, but recreate our hearts; that afford matter of admiration, and ſubject of conſolation.</p>
            <p>Now to what end is all this, if not to induce us to love God, and admire the treaſures and riches of his grace? Our ſpirits are extaſied with the rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and contemplation of thy boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Our words are a degree beneath our thoughts, &amp; yet our thoughts are far beneath the truth. We do but liſp forth thy praiſe; our commendation and elogiums of thee, are but an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dervaluing of thee; for in ſo doing we do but <hi>lumen ſoli praeferre,</hi> or endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to delineate him in his golden treſſes, by the dark draught of a char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coal. Therefore we muſt intreat the Lord, that is our Father, to touch our hearts with a filial affection; that it would pleaſe him that beſtows and infuſeth his love into us, to create alſo in us ſtrong affections and deſires af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuch a divine vertue; that we may pant after, &amp; purſue it with ſo much eagerneſs, as to encounter with all obſtructions for the obtaining of it.</p>
            <pb n="82" facs="tcp:170357:51"/>
            <p>All theſe conſiderations do but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to the love of God, not for our ſelves, but for his own ſake; which is perſpicuous in this, that our Love cannot be regulate, unleſs it be formed and faſhioned on the model of his Love that he bears to us. Now God Loves us for his own ſake, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Prophet <hi>Iſa.</hi> Chap. 43. <hi>'Tis I, 'tis I, that blot away thy trangreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for mine own ſake:</hi> And it is the prayer of holy <hi>Daniel</hi> in the 9. of his prophecy, <hi>Lord hear me, Lord pardon me; O Lord my God tarry not, for thine own ſake; for thy name hath been called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by this people.</hi> God conſiders that we bear his Image on our ſouls; he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders that we are unworthy of his benefits; but that it is a divine thing to do good to thoſe that are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of receiving it; and which is more, to make them worthy in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them good. He looks upon his Church as a ſmall fold that carrieth his name, and are baptized the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, <hi>Hoſea</hi> the 2. nor will he ſuffer it to become the prey of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, or the triumph of their adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries.

            <p>WE have in one Sermon al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſcourſed of our Love of God,<note place="margin">SERM. IV.</note> and infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med you of the ſeveral degrees of this Love, which were five: two where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we have only as yet inſiſted on; the other three we ſhall, <hi>auſpice Christo,</hi> diſpatch in our ſubſequent love-diſcourſe. Therefore not to detain you with the reiteration or repetiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of what you have formerly heard; we'll proceed at preſent to the third degree of our Love to God, which is this, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To Love God ſo far above all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lunary beings, as to affect nothing,<note place="margin">3 Degree.</note> to be enamoured with nothing, but
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:170357:52"/> only for his ſake. As for inſtance, in the vaſt circumference of the terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial Globe, there is variety both of perſons and things, that we cannot withdraw our affections from them, we cannot but love them; and in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, 'twere impiety not to Love them. A Father loveth his Children, a Wife her Husband: our Parents, our Kindred, our Neighbours, our Friends, have all ſhare in this ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. So a man loves his health, and labours to preſerve it: if it be any way loſt, he endeavours by all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble means to recover it. The brawny Peaſant is in his element when whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtling to his Teem, and manuring of his acres. The Scholar is ſo ravi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed with his ſtudy, that his very countenance ſmels of the candle, as the Poet ingeniouſly expreſſeth it;
<q>Livida nocturnam ſapiebant ora lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernam.</q> Their pale countenance did reliſh of the candle; ſpeaking of exceſſive ſtudents. Nay, to go to diſrobe a man of this love, would be a doctrine
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:170357:52"/> inhumane, and a degree below bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality. <hi>He is worſe than an Infidel, that hath not a care of his family,</hi> ſaith the bleſſed Apoſtle. Piety doth not extir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate a mans affections, but cultivates them, and makes them colleagues with the Love and fear of God: No otherwiſe than <hi>Joſhuah,</hi> who having ſubdued the <hi>Gibeonites,</hi> would not put them to death, but compel them to ſervice in the Houſe of God: For then doth a father love his ſons with a real paternal affection, when he reſolves to educate them ſo in their youth, that they may encreaſe in growth, and become plants that one day may fructifie to the glory of God. Then doth a man love his friends as he ought, when their love to God is the efficient cauſe of his love to them; and that he perceives the Image of God ſhine in them. Then ſhall we love our health law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully and aright, when we deſire it, not becauſe it is more pleaſant and comfortable, but becauſe it endowes our bodies with a vigour, and our ſouls with a liberty of ſerving God in our vocation. The ſame may be
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:170357:53"/> ſaid of Riches, Honour, Learning, and the like; theſe are things that one may affect, but ſo, that their love rob us not of our love to God; but rather ſtimulate us on, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke us to good works. And as there is no river ſo ſmall, but diſembogues it ſelf into the Sea; ſo there is none of Gods <hi>benefacta,</hi> though of the loweſt ſize, of the moſt dwarfiſh ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but conducts and leads our thoughts to the profound abyſs of his goodneſs and greatneſs. Then ſhall our affections to our friends be regulated, and ſweetly compoſed, when they ſhall be branches or arms of the Sea of Gods immenſe Love, and have a reflection upon the Image or benefits of God. Set not a price or eſtimation upon men for that that is <hi>about</hi> them, but for what is <hi>in</hi> them: Love not men as you do Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> for the money they have. If you honour a perſon for his ſtately attire, you might as well ſalute the Sattin when intire in a whole piece: If you reverence a man for his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, or renown, you pin his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnity upon his ſleeve, and fix his
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170357:53"/> worth on an airy title: and this is the <hi>mode</hi> now adaies; this is the frame of moſt mens ſpirits in the world, to adore the Casket, and contemn the Jewel that is cabinetted in it; to eſteem the bark, and ſlight the body. It was the ancient com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of devout St. <hi>Bernard, Color, non calor aeſtimatur; veſtium, non vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutum cultus inſiſtitur:</hi> 'Tis the gaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, not the warmth of apparel, that is minded; the trimming of garments, not the adorning of ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, is ſtood upon: 'Tis the lining of his pockets, not that of his brain, that is regarded. Nay <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> Natures elder ſon, was of opinion, that an Aſſe laden with Gold might have a paſs through any gate: 'Tis true in a natural, but not in a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſenſe; for he cannot paſſe through the ſtraight gate of Heaven. 'Tis Gold, <hi>hiſce temporibus ferreis,</hi> that is <hi>omnium Regina,</hi> The Empreſs of the world;

'Tis money that rules, and overrules the whole world. Men riſe early, ſit up late, and eat the bread of carefulneſs; and all for ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the maſs of their treaſure: all is good that procures wealth, be it what it will, or how it will; <hi>per fas, &amp; nefas;</hi> by hook, or by crook, right or wrong; <hi>quo jure, quaque in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juria,</hi> as the Comedian excellently, and ſuitable to our preſent times; whether it be by <hi>Hophnies</hi> fleſh-hook, or <hi>Habakkuks</hi> net; <hi>all's good fiſh that comes to the net.</hi> The holy A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us that <hi>godlineſs is great gain:</hi> but there are many now living that would tell him, if he were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, that great gain is godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; at leaſt, their godlineſs. 'Tis apparel makes a man, now adaies; but if once you be diſrobed of your bravery, and <hi>ad paupertatum redactus,</hi> Then,
<q>
                  <pb n="89" facs="tcp:170357:54"/>Nullus ad amiſſas ibit amicus opes.</q> Then when you are in a thred-bare condition, you ſhall find no friends, few or no viſitations: and whereas before they did ſtick to your thre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhold, and were unwilling to leave your ſociety, now they'll be as nig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gardly of their viſitations, as before they were prodigal of them. Like the Aſſe that carried the Image <hi>Iſis</hi> in proceſſion, when adorned with the ornaments; then did they bow the officious knee; but when ſpoiled and deprived of them, then they come no more about her, but ſhe muſt be ranked with the reſt of her dull, cold, contemptible fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But on the contrary, when your affections are beſtowed on a man, becauſe he fears God, he is firm and ſtable in his faith, advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in the true knowledge of God, true in his words, juſt in his deeds, and charitable to the afflicted, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flamed or eaten up with the zeal of Gods houſe, (not like many of the Puritanical faction, whoſe prepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterous
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:170357:55"/> zeal hath put the whole Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into a combuſtion) your love toward him will continue, as long as he himſelf. Diſpoſſeſs ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of his Lands, deprive him of his Titles, diſrobe him of his gorgeous attire, his body and all his orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments will remain; and that excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency that conſiſts in the Image of God, and the graces of his Spirit.</p>
            <p>I know that the ſecrets or intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mens hearts are profound; and that oftentimes it evenes, that thoſe perſons that we make choice of, and pick out for friends, and vertuous too, become vitious, or elſe demonſtrate unto us they have ever been ſo. In this caſe, he that loves God, ought to reprove his friend, and redreſs him with all his power. Adulation or flattery hath rob'd amity or true love of all its terms, but onely a liberty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving. He that reproves not his friend for fear of incurring his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure, it is a reſpect full of cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty; juſt as if when he were upon the point of drowning, you ſhould be afraid of lifting him up by the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:170357:55"/> hair of the head, for fear of pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off a lock. If he mend not when you reprehend him, the love of man muſt give place to the love of God; you muſt in this caſe do as holy <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> did, who made uſe of his Rod, whileſt it was a Rod; but did flye away from it, when 'twas metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſed into a Serpent: and 'tis bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter far, to ſeparate your ſelf from ſuch a perſon <hi>gradatim,</hi> by degrees, and rather untwiſt your friendſhip with him, than to tear it all to pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</p>
            <p>The Love of God ſerves as a rule to the overcoming and ſubduing all the forementioned difficulties. Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans have amaſſed and pickt up ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral precepts out of the nature of amity, or friendſhip; but never diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered that ſecret that regulates and orders all their precepts. <hi>viz. <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170357:56"/> which it depends. Without this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Love, friendſhip is not friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, but a conſpiracy, an accord of diſcording with God: friendſhip whoſe tottering baſis, or ſhaking foundation, is placed on pleaſure or profit, expires when pleaſures loſe their guſt or taſte through age; or when the profit is diminiſhed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins to moulder and crumble away; or when the diſtribution thereof is unequal. But the love or friendſhip fixed, or rooted in the Love of God, is firm and ſtable; becauſe built up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a ſure foundation: which love ought to proceed ſo far, that we muſt powre out our Love not only upon our friends, but our inteſtine enemies for Gods ſake; 'tis the will and pleaſure of the Almighty, <hi>Matth.</hi> the 5. becauſe that even in the midſt of this enmity, the impreſſion of the Image of God is apparent. And theſe are Rods in Gods hand to jerk us for correction and amendment; and have ſuch a compulſive vertue, as to induce us to fear him.</p>

For although we concede, that ſelf-love is the ſtrongeſt and moſt natural love of man; and it is this <hi>amor</hi>-ſin that is the greateſt Antagoniſt and enemy to the Love of God; and 'twill <hi>opus magnae molis, multi ſudoris,</hi> to overcome and ſurmount it: What the ſhirt is among our cloaths, the ſame is ſelf-love among our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>viz.</hi> the laſt that is pulled off: it is like the laſt onſet or ſally that Satan makes upon a ſoul, that is hard to be repulſed, or made to quit the field: Yet no perſon can love God, <hi>ut deceat,</hi> as it behooveth him, that deteſts not his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that is not irritated againſt his concupiſcence, and wages not a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual war with them, with a firm and Chriſtian reſolution, to ſubdue them, <hi>(Deo juvante)</hi> and to admit of no truce, nor quarter, but to commit a total ſlaughter, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them all, without compaſſion; thirſting after the diſſolution of this body, and reigning with God and

Being wearied out with this fleſhly tabernacle, as in a rouling priſon, or an ambulatory ſepulchre; juſt like a captive cloyſtered up in a loathſome priſon, that peeps at the grates, aſpiring after liberty; you muſt not expect to have egreſs, or depart by the door, but by the ruine of the priſon, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> the diſſolution and deſtruction of the body.

            <p>This is the fourth degree of Love, and the cream and top of Love,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170357:57"/> whileſt we are on this ſide Heaven: 'Twas this degree of Love, that forc'd the holy Apoſtle to ſo pious and que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulous an exclamation; <gap reason="foreign">

The vertues of the Martyrs do check our vices; their pious em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers do reinfuſe heat into our cold walking clay. Whoſe blood, (for as one of the Fathers ſaith) <hi>Sanguis Martyrum ſemen Eccleſiae,</hi> the bloody time of the Saints, is the Seed-time of the Church; their blood, I ſay, exclaims againſt our ſlackneſs, who of late like a ſpurious iſſue have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generated from their conſtancy: And be ſure, if we imitate them not, and follow their example, they will be a reproach and condemnation un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to

But all is not yet ended; the rebellious and contumacious, ſurrenders not her ſelf up yet; for oftentimes, after ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolutions, at certain intervals, or ſpaces of time, there will arrive ſome cooling kind of temper, that may induce and perſwade carnal reaſon to a poſtarize, and eſpecially in theſe rebellious times; where a man may find more matter for to compoſe a book of Apoſtates, rather than Martyrs.

Luſt will ſtruggle and ſtrive for ſuperiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore ought to be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and held in ſubjection by the power of Gods Spirit, operating in, and aiding of us. Man is his own

O the wretched nature and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of men, that procure (or at leaſt endeavour it) their own ruine! O the fixed and faſt rooted corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of man, that by their mutinies will relead us, or compel us to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn into <hi>Aegypt!</hi> that after our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of <hi>Sodom,</hi> perſwade us, like <hi>Lots</hi> Wife, to look back, and have a kind of internal regret, for the evil we have forſaken. Theſe are cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions that interpoſe, and diſturb our beſt actions with wicked ſugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions, and beſpatter them with ſome evil. If we ſeriouſly meditate on death, the fleſh will ſuggeſt, and ſay; What needs all theſe melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly dumps? To what purpoſe all theſe ſighs and erected eyes? There is time enough for that hereafter. If we read or near Gods judgements and menaces againſt infamous ſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let ſinners, the fleſh perſwades us,
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:170357:61"/> that it belongs to others, not to us. If we comtemplate the Heavens, 'twill ſuggeſt unto us immediately, that we ſhall arrive there ſoon enough.

            <p>Therefore in this caſe, we muſt carefully and piouſly repair unto God, craving his divine aſſiſtance; and imitate <hi>Rebecca,</hi> who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe unto God by prayer, when two <hi>Embryones</hi> or infants ſtrove in her womb; a moſt exact figure, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine

So God anſwers unto <hi>Rebecca,</hi> telling her, that <hi>the greateſt ſhould obey the leaſt.</hi> For the old man muſt be brought in ſubjection to the new, till he be perfectly reduced to the obedience of God; he muſt be over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come totally, and his forces quite routed.</p>
            <p>Now we are arrived to the top of the Ladder, the fifth and laſt degree,<note place="margin">5 Degree.</note> which is the Love whereby we ſhall love God in the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, when we ſhall be cloathed with the Robes of Eternal Glory. For our Love proceeds from our knowledge; and according to our knowledge, we proportion our Love: Then ſhall we love God far more, becauſe we ſhall know him far better. <hi>Now we ſee</hi> (ſaith the bleſſed Apoſtle) <hi>through a glaſs dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but then face to face:</hi>

               <pb n="104" facs="tcp:170357:62"/> very emphaticall, <hi>in a riddle.</hi> Our love that looks a great diſtance, and is diſtracted by variety of objects, ſhall then approach, and look near, and ſhall be totally fixed upon God. And as two great rivers that have forſaken their conſtant chanel, and meeting together, cauſe a terrible inundation: ſo the Love of God are two currents that ſhall be joyned whileſt on earth; but when we ſhall arrive, and land on the ſhoar of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal felicity, they will meet in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven. How unutterable will the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemency of theſe affections be, when they ſhall be joyned and ſwallowed up one within the other with a mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Love? For then in loving God, we ſhall alſo love our ſelves; becauſe that God ſhall dwell in us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe according to the holy Apoſtle St. <hi>John,</hi>

Nor muſt we doubt, or imagine, that there is not an entire and real Love and mutual affection among the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Angels, but it flows from the Love of God: Therefore let us love nothing in our ſelves, that prepares
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:170357:62"/> us not for the expectation of that Love, that is mingled with the Love of God; a rare and Sacred Doſe, compoſed of two incomparable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredients, to cure the diſtemper of ſin-ſick man.</p>
            <p>But becauſe that Love with which we ſhall love God in Paradiſe, hath its original from the ſight and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation of his glorious aſpect, (for <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, Love is enflamed by ſight:) Let us endeavour to find out what this ſight ſhall be, that is the cauſe of our Love. The eyes of the body behold all things, two ways, or by two means: either by a reception of the image or ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and ſo we behold and ſee all bodies expoſed to our view; or in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving into our eyes the ſelf-ſame thing that we ſee, as we ſee the light, which enters into our very ſight. God that is the <hi>primum lumen,</hi> or <hi>lumen luminum,</hi> will manifeſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto us in Heaven, this laſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner: for he dwelleth in his Saints; he is to them <hi>all in all.</hi>
               <note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> But in this life we ſee him in his image, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> by the contemplation of his works,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170357:63"/> whereon he hath made an impreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or engraven as it were his own portraicture, and expreſs and ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficant <hi>indicia</hi> or marks of his vertue. We ſhall then ſee God as we do the light here below; but that we do only ſee it through the windows of our bodies, <hi>viz.</hi> our eyes; but then we ſhall receive on every ſide the light of Gods countenance, that will light us every where with the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of its rays, and the beams of its tranſlucent glory: like a man that, if it were poſſible, could be apple of the eye all over, compoſed of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe, he would receive the light from all parts round about him.</p>
            <p>This ſight of God will transform us into his likeneſs or ſimilitude: ſo ſaith St. <hi>John,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 John 3.2.</note> 
               <hi>We ſhall be like unto him; for we ſhall behold him, as he is;</hi>

For as a look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-glaſs or mirrour, if it be expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to the Sun, will repreſent the reſemblance or image thereof; ſo God entertains no body with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to contemplate his face, but he transforms him into his own likeneſs
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:170357:63"/> or ſimilitude, by the irradiation of his ſplendor and perfection. And if God be Charity and <hi>Love,</hi> as the holy Apoſtle St. <hi>John</hi> affirms, and all Chriſtians are engaged to believe, in the 1. of St. <hi>John,</hi> 4 Chap. 8 verſ. it follows of neceſſity, that the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture being by this beatifical viſion made like unto God, ſhould be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſhed with love, and all on a flame with this ſpiritual fire: Such a fire as hath impoſed a name on the Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims, to termed, becauſe of their ardor; which is no other thing but the Love of God, the fervor of their zeal, and their promptitude and agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in his ſervice.</p>

            <p>And as there are five degrees of our Love to God, ſo there are five marks or tokens viſible enough, whereby we may diſcern whether or no we have the true Love of God;<note place="margin">5 Marks of Gods Love.</note> which we ſhall only enumerate, and ſo conclude for the preſent.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">1 Mark.</note>The firſt mark or token of our Love to God, is this, <hi>viz.</hi> It extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſheth all other unchaſte and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Love.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">2 Mark.</note>The ſecond mark and effect of this Love, is, the peace and tranquillity of the ſoul and conſcience.</p>
            <pb n="111" facs="tcp:170357:65"/>
            <p>The third mark, is,<note place="margin">3 Mark.</note> our Love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Neighbour.</p>
            <p>The fourth mark, is,<note place="margin">4 Mark.</note> the delight and pleaſure that we have and take in communing and converſing with God.</p>
            <p>The fifth mark is,<note place="margin">5 Mark.</note> a zeal for the glory of God, that is increaſed or diminiſhed according as God is ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured or diſhonoured.</p>
            <p>He, whoſoever he be, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives theſe effects wrought in him, may aſſure himſelf that he loves God with a true, real, and religious Love: and though it may happen ſometimes, that his love may be aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the heat of his zeal be ſomewhat quenched, the vigor of his affection ſomewhat debilitated; though this Love be weak, yet it argues it not to be falſe, it is true for all that: for as a weak faith is a good faith, ſo a weak love is a good love. The very Apoſtles themſelves were termed by our Saviour <hi>men of little faith:</hi> though it be ſmall, ſo it encreaſe <hi>indies,</hi> day
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:170357:66"/> by day, tending to perfection; 'twill without doubt end in happineſs and eternal joy.</p>
            <p>Thus have I laid down theſe five degrees or marks of our true love to God; which I ſhall deſiſt from diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſing any farther on at preſent; but commit you to God, and leave the handling of them to the next op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity: If God permit. Amen.</p>

               <hi>that walks in the night,</hi> ſaid Jeſus Chriſt the true light of the World, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.10. And <hi>he that walketh in darkneſs, knows not whither he goes,</hi> ſaid his beloved diſciple. If there be any thing wherein this may be clearly known, is is in the miſtake of judgement, which thoſe make of themſelves, who being deſtitute of the celeſtial light of verity, ſuffer themſelves to be led away by their own natural darkneſs. For there is nothing more frequent in their mouths, then the complaint of their misfortunes; nor nothing more rare then the confeſſion of their faults:
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:170357:67"/> they out-ſpeak their puniſhments, and palliate their crimes; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare themſelves miſerable, but would not be thought wicked: you ſhall often hear the Philoſophers call man a dream of a ſhaddow, a wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-cock of inconſtancy, an exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of weakneſs, a general rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous of dolours and misfortunes: A <hi>Democritus</hi> laughing at his folly, an <hi>Heraclitus</hi> bemoaning his calamities. The one termes thoſe happy that go quickly out of the world, and th'other thoſe more happy that never come into it. All too much occupied in the ſenſe of their miſery, but never in ſearching or acknowledging their ſins: All accuſing Nature as a ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dame, but no man himſelf as a rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious or diſobedient child. He of all men ſeems to have beſt hit of mans condition, who hath qualified him the miſerableſt and proudeſt of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: for whereas all declamations upon the pitiful eſtate of humane nature, ought to be ſo many lively leſſons of true humility; and that cloud of misfortunes that ſhowres on their heads, bring them down as
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:170357:67"/> low as the centre of the earth: on the contrary, like balloones full of wind, the more they are preſſed down, the higher they riſe: and as it happens in the agitation of a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent tempeſt, the ſame wave break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, makes them ſink into the deeps; and keeping it ſelf whole and ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, carries them again up into the clouds. And their preſumption, like a kind of folly, drowning at once both memory and ſenſe of their miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes, you ſee them raiſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves again in their own good opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, and rejoyce in the light of their underſtandings; they gaze up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves in the ſplendor of their vertues, and loſe themſelves in the ſubtilty of their inventions; and to make themſelves happy, to depend on no other decree then that of their own wills, to call in no other help then the ſtrength of their own ſouls. <hi>Our life</hi> (ſayes one) <hi>we have from God; but that we live well and holy, is to be attributed to ourſelves. We muſt</hi> (ſayes another) <hi>demand our fortune of God, but we muſt ſeek for wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in our ſelves. Every one</hi> (ſayes
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:170357:68"/> another) <hi>hath riches of his own acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for if it were given him from God, he ſhould deſerve no commendations.</hi> Never any of the wiſe-men gave thanks to God for making him ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous; ſo that by this reckoning of theirs, thoſe people who were late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charged with misfortunes, are now found free from faults: They that are moſt miſerable upon earth, think themſelves moſt worthy of heaven: They who cannot defend themſelves from the leaſt creatures, think they have themſelves and every thing elſe in their power: They who for the tooth-ache, made vowes to <hi>Aeſculapius,</hi> for the health of their cattle, and the conſervation of their corn, ſacrificed to <hi>Pan</hi> and <hi>Ceres,</hi> do not hold themſelves obliged to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thanks to God, for the vertues and excellent qualities that ſpring and grow in their ſouls.</p>
            <p>That the Pagans (who are ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to the Covenant, and ignorant of the way of God, deſtitute of the light of his Holy Word) ſhould be thus carried and toſt by ſo contrary opinions in the judgement of their
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:170357:68"/> own condition; it ſeems nothing ſtrange: But that they that call themſelves Chriſtians, ſeeing ſhine in their climate theſe two great lights, the Goſpel and the Law, that they ſhould go ſtumbling as in the twylight, and groping like men without their eyes; and without power either in themſelves, of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greatneſs of their miſeries, or without themſelves of knowing the vertue of the grace and infinity of the mercies of God; that they ſhould go halting on both ſides: ſometime raiſing themſelves to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by their own poor merits; at another time ſinking down as low as hell in deſpair, even by diſtruſt of the gift of God; and of the other ſide rendring themſelves alike un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy, and throwing themſelves into ſuch a diſtance of his favour: this ſeems openly to verifie the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint of the Evangeliſt, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.5. that <hi>light hath ſhined in darkneſs, but the darkneſs comprehended it not;</hi> that his <hi>light came into the world,</hi> but that the <hi>world rather loved darkneſs, then light.</hi> So that it becomes no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170357:69"/> if reaping the fruit of what they ſo much loved; they have alſo for their part errour, uncertainty, and aſtoniſhment, the ordinary companions of the night: And if whereas the truly faithful, who by the light of the Law acknowledging their demerits, and by the light of the Goſpel embracing the merits of the Redeemer of the World, ſay with <hi>Job, I know that my Redeemer li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth;</hi> with the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. <hi>I know on whom I have believed,</hi> with the wel-beloved diſciple. 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3.19. <hi>We know that we are of God;</hi> theſe men, dazled with a vain opinion of their own vertues, and undervaluing the redemption of the Lord Jeſus, ſay, We know not whither we ſhall go; we know not if we believe; we know not whether we ſhall be ſaved.</p>
            <p>But if herein they would acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge their blindneſs, there were ſome hope of bringing them back to the light; but they are ſo far from this, that in this uncertainty and wandring of their troubled ſouls, they find no infirmity; but on the contrary, this is that which they
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170357:69"/> ſay, <hi>We ſee:</hi> and to ſay truth, they take a pleaſure in their errour, as if it were in the brighteſt clarity; and upon theſe floting waves and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainties, they eſtabliſh the higheſt perfection of their faith: Attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting alſo to the faireſt of all the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, the three moſt vitious and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject paſſions that are to be found in all corrupted nature, which are, <hi>Ignorance, Uncertainty,</hi> and <hi>Fear;</hi> keeping in blindneſs that which ſhould guide us through the dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this world, and whoſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal action is to ſee; for, <hi>by faith they of old have ſeen the promiſes, and ſaluted them afar of,</hi> Heb. 11.13. not ſtaggering through unbelief, but like <hi>Abraham,</hi> that was ſtrengthned by faith: not fearful and trembling, but being <hi>born of God,</hi> to <hi>overcome the world,</hi> 1 Joh. 5.4. What brave ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploits can be expected from a Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pion that muſt fight a combat after his eyes be put out, or his ſoul filled with fear and aſtoniſhment? <hi>Curſed are they that call evil good, and good evil; bitter to be ſweet, and ſweet bitter; darkneſs to be light, and light darkneſs,</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:170357:70"/> Iſai. 5.20. To this it is that we would now ſend back theſe Doctors of darkneſs, that we might once be rid of them; and by the lively clari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Jobs</hi> faith, make you follow and conſider the true object, where ours ſhould reſt; and there to ſearch for her true nouriture and advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; if we were not for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent hindred, by that bold ſacriledge whereby they ſeek to make holy Scripture a party to their wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and to be the cryer for their diſhoneſt gain; making it as much as they can, belie her own nature, which is to be the light and ſure guide of ſoules, to make it ſerve for a cloak to the night, and as a fantoſm for aſtoniſhments, wherewith they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex conſciences.</p>
            <p>They ſay their doctrine is that of Eccleſiaſtes, <hi>Eccl.</hi> 9.1. who ſaith, that <hi>the righteous, and the wiſe, and their works, are in the hand of God;</hi> and yet <hi>no man knoweth either love or hatred that is before them;</hi> but <hi>all things are kept in uncertainty for the time to come.</hi> If theſe were the words of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> they had ſome appearance of reaſon
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:170357:70"/> in them: but that which makes moſt expreſs for their opinion, is not the words of the wiſe, but the additions and falſe expoſitions of the vulgar Verſion, whereof they make uſe, and of which by an unparallelled bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they correct the Originals. For this laſt clauſe, <hi>that all things are kept in uncertainty for the time to come,</hi> is not at all in the Hebrew Text; and the reſt is only coucht in theſe terms; <hi>The juſt, and the wiſe, and their works, are in the hand of God, and no man knoweth either love, or hatred, that is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</hi> Where you ſee what a violence is uſed to draw out of theſe words a certain concluſion againſt the certainty of faith. For it is a thing to be obſerved, that in the Holy tongue many times love and hatred are taken for the things which one loves or hates; and that which is tranſlated to <hi>know,</hi> ſignifies as often to <hi>diſpoſe</hi> or to <hi>make uſe</hi> of a thing at our pleaſure: as, where it is ſaid in <hi>Job</hi> 38.33. <hi>Doſt thou know the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of the Heavens, or doſt thou di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoſe of the government of each of them upon Earth?</hi> And in this ſenſe they
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170357:71"/> are not altogether without reaſon, that turn this verſe thus: <hi>But all things are ſo in the hand of God, that none of men can uſe or diſpoſe at his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of what he either hates or loves.</hi> Others, as <hi>Arias Montanus,</hi> think that by <hi>that which is before them,</hi> the wiſe man meant <hi>thoſe</hi> that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; as friends, Parents, or Domeſtickes, who many times under a veil of friendſhip conceal their ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treds and mortal envies, which are very hardly diſcovered while they can be concealed under a feigned ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. Others underſtand this uncertainty of events of our love and hatred, which are ſo hidden from us, that they fall out often contrary to our deſires; and ſometimes ſo croſs, that to day we hate, what we muſt love hereafter, and love that which we muſt ere long deteſt. But with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtraying as much as may be from the literal ſenſe, 'tis clear enough, eſpecially if we conſider what imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately follows, which ſerves both as a light and interpretation to this paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage: that is, That <hi>all happens alike to all, and the ſame accidents to the good
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170357:71"/> and the bad:</hi> for the wiſeman would have us know, that by exterior things, by the ordinary courſe of the world, and the good or evil that can be diſcern'd by the eyes of fleſh, it is very hard to diſtinguiſh who are lov'd or hated of God; as 'tis alſo dangerous to go about to judge of Gods curſe or grace, by th' adverſity or proſperity of men. And here the friends of <hi>Job</hi> were deceived, when upon the evils that fell upon him, they would conclude againſt him both the hatred of God, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>purity of his own life. And here the Jews likewiſe abuſed themſelves, when they ſaid, <hi>We eſteem the proud to be bleſſed, and they that have tempted God were delivered.</hi> And to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Pſalmiſt tells us, 37.7, 9. <hi>Fret not thy ſelf, becauſe of him who proſpereth in his way, and who bringeth wicked de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices to paſs: for evil doers ſhall be cut off; but thoſe that wait upon the Lord, they ſhall inherit the earth.</hi> Sometimes the righteous man mourns under the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and he that walks upright is ſubject to a thouſand evils, &amp; the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked are terrible, and <hi>flouriſhing like a
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170357:72"/> green bay-tree,</hi> and <hi>they have more then their heart could wiſh,</hi> Pſal. 73.7. And ſometimes alſo joy and the voice of ſinging and triumph is heard in the tabernacles of the righteous, and the wicked man is enſnar'd and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown by his own iniquities. And ſo it is a hard matter to judge of this immutable will of God by accidents ſo divers and changeable: But it goes far otherwiſe with the inward ſenſe of conſcience; for the moſt righteous among men (ſetting their life and works before the clearneſs of Gods juſtice) do know well, and profeſs openly, that they find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves worthy of hatred: and ſo <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> ſaid, <hi>We are conſumed by thee, we are troubled by thy wrath; thou haſt ſet our iniquities before thee, our ſecret ſins in the light of thy countenance,</hi> Pſal. 90.7, 8. For this the Pſalmiſt cryes out, <hi>Enter not into judgement with thy ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, for no fleſh is righteous in thy ſight.</hi> And <hi>Daniel</hi> avowing the verity and juſtice of Gods judgements, ſaid, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.7. <hi>Lord, with thee there is ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, but ſhame and confuſion of face unto us.</hi> So the Centurion ſaid,
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170357:72"/> Matth. 8.8. <hi>I am not worthy that thou ſhouldſt enter under my roof;</hi> and the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> eſteemed himſelf <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to be an Apoſtle,</hi> 1 Cor. 23.9. But theſe men returning toward the compaſſions of God, and relying upon the merits of the Redeemer of the World, have not ceaſed to eſteem themſelves, in him, and for his ſake, worthy of eternal life. And upon this aſſurance <hi>David</hi> ſaith, Pſal. 16.11. <hi>Thou ſhalt make me to know the way of life. Daniel</hi> beſought the Eternal, <hi>that according to all his righteouſneſs, his anger and fury might be turn'd away from Jeruſalem.</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures himſelf, that <hi>the Crown of Juſtice is reſerved for him,</hi> 2 Tim. 4.8. And in the <hi>Apocalypſe</hi> 'tis ſaid of thoſe that have <hi>not defiled their garments</hi> in the corruptions of the world, that <hi>they ſhall walk with the Lamb in white cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: for they are WORTHY,</hi> Apoc. 3.4.</p>
            <p>And this conſideration furniſhes an anſwer to another paſſage, which they alleadge to as little purpoſe, as they have maliciouſly falſified this, which we have now anſwered. This
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170357:73"/> is the ſaying of the Apoſtle, 1 Cor. 4.4. <hi>I find my ſelf guilty in nothing: but for this I am not juſtified:</hi> A paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage that cuts their throats; For without doubt, they dare not ſay that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was not aſſured of his ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſince to ſome other paſſages we have already produced, that had no other ſubterfuge, but that he was aſſured of it by particular revelation. What is it then the Apoſtle would ſay, but that this inward conſcience (whereof his conſcience bears him witneſs) is not ſufficient to juſtifie him before God? And of this he does not ſpeak doubting, but as in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Galatians</hi> he had ſaid, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.10. That <hi>all they that are of the Law, are under malediction; and all they that ſeek to be juſtified by the Law, are fallen from grace,</hi> Gal. 5.4. Thus he pronounces openly, and without any ſort of uncertainty, that by this he is not juſtified. And yet it muſt be obſerved, that this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior ſentiment of his innocency, is not extended over all the actions of his life; for by that which followes, may eaſily be comprehended, that
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170357:73"/> he ſpeaks only of the execution of his charge, wherein being conducted by the Spirit of God, he knows he hath gone right: As he ſaid in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other place, 2 Cor. 1.12. <hi>This is now the teſtimony of our conſcience, that in ſimplicity and ſincerity, and not in carnal wiſdome, but according to the grace of God, we have convers'd with the world, and chiefly toward you.</hi> Now he that in ſome one of the actions and occupations of his life, finds himſelf innocent, will yet not ſtick to acknowledge himſelf, in conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of other things, culpable. And thus we ſee that <hi>David</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſpeaking of ſome action and particular cauſe wherein he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plores the juſtice of God againſt his enemies, does yet glorifie himſelf in his integrity to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18. to have <hi>kept the wayes of the Lord, and not wickedly to have departed:</hi> but elſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where he confeſſes his faults; and in the 19 <hi>Pſal.</hi> he prayes the Lord, ſaying, <hi>Keep back thy ſervant from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous ſins; let them not have domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion over me: then ſhall I be upright, and innocent from the great tranſgreſsion.</hi>
               <pb n="128" facs="tcp:170357:74"/> And the Apoſtle himſelf, who in the exerciſe of his Apoſtleſhip finds himſelf exempt of fault, yet forgets not to ſigh and demand deliverance from this <hi>law of his members,</hi> which makes him <hi>carnal, and ſold under ſin,</hi> Rom. 7.24. And this excellent Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of the Spirit of God knew very well, that to obtain juſtification by works, it was neceſſary that works ſhould be perfect, and innocency and ſanctification ſhould be entire, as well in their parts, as their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees; becauſe that <hi>he that fails in one point</hi> of the Law, makes himſelf <hi>guilty of the tranſgreſsion of all;</hi> and that no ſingle action, though perfect in it ſelf, can make a perfection of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice: whereas one ſin alone is able to ſlay the ſoul, to terniſh the luſtre, and corrupt the value of all prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent juſtices; and therefore he aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons this feeble prop, whereon who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever thinks to rely, remains al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies in uncertainty: And therefore not to teſtifie any incertitude of his ſalvation, but to affirm the aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it upon a foundation inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable, he reputes <hi>all things,</hi> even
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170357:74"/> his own innocency, <hi>as dung; that he may gain Chriſt, and be found in him, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving not his own juſtice, which is of the Law; but the juſtice of God, which is by faith in Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is then to beat the air, and fight with his own ſhadow, to go about to ſhew the weakneſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmity of man, to ſound the depth of the malice of his heart, and to open the dark corners and retraicts of his hypocriſie: we confeſſe more then they can accuſe us of; being only ſorry that it is out of an envy to do ill, in troubling the conſciences, and not the love of the truth, which pulls this confeſſion from our mouth, that <hi>no man living can ſay, My heart is clean, and I am pure from ſin:</hi> and yet at other times, they conteſt with this confeſſion, when they fall upon the ſtrength of their free will, and to eſtabliſh their works of ſupereroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Yes, it is true, that <hi>there is no juſt man on earth that doth well, and ſins not,</hi> Eccl. 7.21. <hi>In many things we offend all,</hi> James 3.2. <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin, we are lyars,</hi> 1 Joh. All the moſt holy among men have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170357:75"/> their ſins before God, <hi>Job</hi> 15.15. and why not? ſince <hi>the Heavens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are not pure before him; He put no trust in his ſervants, and his Angels he charged with folly,</hi> Job 4.18. But ſo little doth this confeſſion ſhake the aſſurance of the faith, that contrary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it ſettles it ſo much the more, becauſe hereby a man is led to go forth of himſelf, to go and put his whole affiance in the only mercy of God; and to withdraw all his hopes from the merit of his own works, to rely entirely upon the infinite merits of him, <hi>who of God is made unto us, wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and righteouſneſs, and ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and redemption,</hi> 1 Cor. 1.30. <hi>Of our ſelves we have not ſo much as a good thought, but all our ſufficiency com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth from God;</hi> but yet <hi>able to do all things in him that ſtrengthens us,</hi> Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip. 4.13. we are combated by him, but we are in all things <hi>more then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>querors through him that loved us,</hi> Rom. 8.36. And very well ſaid St. <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nard</hi> in the fifth Homily of the dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Temple, entring into conſideration of the ſoul: <hi>I ſeem to have found two things contrary to each
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170357:75"/> other; for if I behold it ſuch as it is in it ſelf, and of it ſelf, I cannot ſpeak bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then in ſaying that it is reduced to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing: for what need is it for me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count all her miſeries, how it is charged with ſins, envelopt in darkneſs, envi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron'd with temptations, boyling with luſts, ſubject to paſsions, fill'd with illuſions, inclined to vice, full of ſhame and confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions? If all the righteouſneſs of man be before God nothing but pollution, what ſhall be his unrighteouſneſs? If there be nothing but darkneſs in his light, how obſcure then ſhall be the darkneſs it ſelf? What ſhall I then ſay? For certain man is nothing but vanity, he is reduc'd to nothing, man is nothing: But how is he thus nothing, whom God ſo magnifies? How is he nothing, ſince Godſets his heart upon him? Let us have courage: although we be nothing in our hearts, yet we ſhall find in Gods heart ſomething hidden of us. O Father of mercies! O Father of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable! how is it that thou ſetſt thy heart upon us? for thy treaſure is where is thy heart: and how are we thy treaſure, if we be nothing? Certainly in the judgment of thy verity we are nothing, but not ſo in the affection of thy piety and goodneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="132" facs="tcp:170357:76"/>
            <p>But why, ſay they, if we have ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute aſſurance of our Salvation, are there ſo many advertiſements given us in holy Scripture, to <hi>take heed to our ſelves;</hi> to <hi>watch,</hi> to <hi>pray,</hi> and that <hi>he that ſtands take heed he do not fall?</hi> and if theſe be truly profitable, as it is to be preſum'd; then this is a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony that a man may fall; and conſequently, that he cannot ſtand firm in his aſſurance.</p>
            <p>To this we anſwer: That the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortations and threatnings in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which are commonly made, ought to be applied according to the quality and neceſſity of every one: The viſible Church, to which the Word of God is announced, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of divers ſorts of people; ſome have need of a bridle, others of a ſpur; ſome to be held back by threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings from their abandoned vices; others to be waken'd from a natural lethargy by lively exhortations: to ſome, conſolation; to others, corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is neceſſary. There are that abuſe themſelves, who under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text of exterior piety, wherein they ſeem very zealous, thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170357:76"/> to be high-flown upon the wings of a holy devotion, while avarice and luxury, and other vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, have tyed them faſt to earth, and drag them through the dirt: To theſe men, the ſaying of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle addreſſes properly, 1 Cor. 10.12. that <hi>he that thinks he ſtands, take heed leſt he fall:</hi> and thoſe that ſtand truly, ought not to ſlight this ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but rather to take it (not as a preſage of their misfortune, but) as a teſtimony, that although of our ſelves we are ſubject to fall, yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs God would not have us fall, becauſe he directs his word to us; who putting us in mind of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, conducts us more and more to ſeek the confirmation of his grace: And then to fall, is not to make a total loſs of our ſalvation, but only a ſtumbling or a fall in a ſpiritual courſe; a thing that may happen to the moſt righteous; and yet not that they ſhould fall from the hope of their ſalvation, becauſe they are ſoon again reſtored by repentance; For if <hi>the just man fall,</hi> yet he can fall no farther, becauſe <hi>the Lord holds
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:170357:77"/> him by the hand,</hi> Pſal. 37.24. And ſo theſe exhortations tend only to make us diſtruſt our ſelves, but not to raviſh us of the confidence we ought to have in God: They fight with the carnal ſecurity of profane ones, but not with the faith of the children of God, to whom they ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſerve as means to advance them towards that glory which they wait for, rendring by a holy vigilance the hope of their vocation ſtill more firm.</p>
            <p>Yet they will ſay, There is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much recommended to us in Scripture, as fear: <hi>Work out your ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation with FEAR and trembling,</hi> Philip. 2.12. <hi>Happy is the man that FEARETH alwayes,</hi> Prov. 28.14. <hi>Be not high-minded, but FEAR,</hi> Rom. 11.20. <hi>Paſs the time of your ſojourning here in FEAR,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.17. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, if it were neceſſary to oppoſe to theſe paſſages that recommend fear, thoſe that chaſe it from our hearts; for one, we might oppoſe thirty, there being nothing more common in all the courſe of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, then theſe words, which are
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:170357:77"/> addreſt to the faithful, <hi>Fear not:</hi> But the Word of God never belies it ſelf, and therefore 'tis neceſſary, that there be a fear of two ſorts; one, that is compatible with aſſurance, a good, a holy, a commendable fear; becauſe it leads us to God: the other, that extinguiſhes it, and makes us flye from the face of God, as <hi>Adam</hi> did after his ſin, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.8. and this is that which the fear of God ought to chaſe and baniſh from every faithful ſoul: And therefore 'tis no wonder, if fear and aſſurance be met in one and the ſame ſubject, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers reſpects. So when I conſider the Law, with thoſe thunders and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and threatnings and curſes, my ſoul is ready to vaniſh for fear: but when I turn my ſelf to the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious promiſes of the Goſpel, ſhe fills her ſelf with aſſurance: when I conſider my own demerit, I enter into diſtruſt; but under the merits of Chriſt, I re-aſſure my ſelf again: I tremble over the pendant ſlippery paths of this life; but I comfort my ſelf, when I ſee the hand of God that ſuſtains me: And thus I <hi>ſerve
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:170357:78"/> the Lord in fear,</hi> and <hi>rejoyce before him in trembling,</hi> Pſal. 2.11. This is that filial fear that makes Gods chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren prudent in their waies; not that <hi>ſpirit of fear,</hi> that torments the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of the wicked, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. not that which proceeds from diſtruſt of power, or deſpair of the good will of God; but which is born out of the knowledge of dangers that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viron us, and from the ſenſe of our own infirmity: not that which trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles for puniſhment, but that which is apprehenſive for the ſin: not that which flyes from the face of God; but that which hath recourſe to his grace: And ſuch a one, as if there were no puniſhment nor recompenſe, no Hell nor Paradiſe, would not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit her duty toward God, but would take heed to diſpleaſe him: This goes equal ſteps with that aſſurance which is reckoned among the gifts that are ſhed upon the Son of God, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 12.2. who was not able to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into any diſtruſt of the love of his Father.</p>
            <p>But what relation to this reverence of true children to their father, hath
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:170357:78"/> this trouble, and uncertain trembling fear, which the Roman Doctors caſt into mens conſciences? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly among ſo divers fluctuations, wherewith (as impetuous winds) our ſouls ſince ſin are miſerably agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated; there is none more ſtrange, then this fear; nor among the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherewith God threatens and puniſhes the wicked, there is none more terrible then this cry of fear, which he ſends <hi>into their eares,</hi> Job 15.21. This trembling heart, this dimneſs of eyes, this diſtreſs of ſoul, which makes their life ſo doubtful before them, that <hi>at evening they ſay,</hi> Deut. 28.67. <hi>Who ſhall let us ſee the morning? and in the morn they demand, Who ſhall let us ſee the evening?</hi> Fear, like a terrible voice, wakens the ſoul by ſtartings, and ſo ſeizes it, that it remains inſenſible to every thing, except that ſtroke of aſtoniſhment that beats it; and from that which is nothing, makes it feel a thouſand dolorous paſſions: and whereas we feel not other evils, more then they are in us, and the cauſe remains there: yet fear calls back evils that
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:170357:79"/> are paſt: multiplying and engroſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing thoſe that are preſent, and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipating thoſe that are not yet, and perhaps that ſhall never be; and ſo forges imaginary torments, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it makes miſerable ſouls ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of a thouſand real ſorrows. The mortal enemy of all repoſe, it ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages in an inſtant whatſoever is either pleaſant or delightful in life: and like a feaveriſh heat, it infects and imbitters the beſt prepared ſweetneſſes; bringing in a profound ſadneſs into our hearts; which ſo gnawes and undermines them, as the ruſt doth ſteel, and makes us draw a life after us, more miſerable then death: Inconſiderate paſſion! which continually repreſents to our eyes the image of the danger that attends us, and is thereby ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome, that we can neither ſee, nor foreſee for remedies: neither more, nor leſs, then an abyſſe, where waters drawn out of the deep, whirl about with ſo much impetuoſity, giving us afar off the warning of ſhip-wrack, and yet draws us in by ſuch an aſtoniſhment, that we are
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:170357:79"/> plunged and ſwallowed up in the gulf that we would ſo fain eſcape.</p>
            <p>Thus it awakes in our ſouls a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement deſire to avoid that miſchief that treads upon our heeles; but it ſo troubles and aſtoniſhes all our ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, that loſing both our judgment and diſcourſe, we precipitate our ſelves into the danger from which our fear ſeems to lend us wings; and then it happens to us, as at other times we dream, when preſt by ſome enemies as we think, or by ſome hideous fantoſm, we ſeek to flye away, but cannot, becauſe our heavy bodies, or elſe our traſht feet, will not follow our deſire: or if a light ſeeming ſwiftneſs anſwer our fear, and ſeem to skip over furlongs, yet which way ſo ever we turn in the trouble of this affright, though pant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for pain; this funeral-object meets us every where, giving us the chaſe, and leaving us nothing but complaint; in which we would fain cry out, but cannot, becauſe the apprehenſion ſtops our voice, and tyes up our trembling and ſtamme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring tongue to the roof of our
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:170357:80"/> mouths: So thoſe that are ſeized with this paſſion, apprehend every thing, and fall foul upon all: They are afraid of their dreams; they are troubled at their fancies: They give themſelves to be abuſed by lying ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; they take all that they meet with for ill preſages; and ſometimes come to fall into ſuch a confuſion of ſpirit, that they throw themſelves head-long into deſpair. Hiſtories af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford us but too many examples of thoſe who being unable to deliver themſelves from this paſſion, have yielded up themſelves to death, find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ſweetneſs in death, then in the fear of dying. Whoſoever beholds an affrighted man, may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read in the tracts of his viſage, and in all the actions of his body, what the trouble and confuſion is that agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates his ſoul: for, to obſerve his ſcattered eyes, his bleak face, his pale and ſhaking lips, his dry mouth, his furred tongue, his confuſed voice, his beating heart, his panting flanks, his knees knocking together, his ſtumbling feet, and all the movings of the body trembling and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain;
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:170357:80"/> what can be ſaid, but that his body is ſo miſerably agitated, that his ſoul muſt be in great diſorder? And in this condition, it is as unca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to produce a good action, as to take good counſel; but from thence, as from an infernal jakes, do iſſue the moſt infamous vices and execrable actions that can be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by men. And as in an army after a terrour taken, the battalions break their rankes in diſorder; all flye, all run, and nothing ſeen but blood and ſlaughter: ſo it is when fear poſſeſſes the ſoul; ſhe troubles her ſelf; all vertues abandon her, and the vices make a horrible waſt and ſpoil. From hence ſprung up ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, and ſo many execrable ſacrifices, the very report whereof breeds horrour. Cruelty claims her for her mother; perfidiouſneſs, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and diſſembling, owe her their original: She hath hatcht tyranny and ill counſels; and it is none but ſhe, that breaking the ſacred bonds of nature, is capable to animate fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and mothers againſt their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per blood, and their own bowels.
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:170357:81"/> In a word, 'tis impoſſible to love the thing which we fear. Behold then this monſter which theſe Doctors nouriſh in theſe poor ſouls, which God by ſo many promiſes of his love and aſſiſtance, chaſes and bani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhes from the hearts of his children: <hi>Fear not, little flock; for it is your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers pleaſure to give you a Kingdom,</hi> Luk. 12.32.</p>
            <p>Nay but, ſay they, To day I am well aſſured, but who can continue me this aſſurance till to morrow and afterwards? <hi>He that perſeveres to the end, ſhall be ſaved,</hi> Matth. 24.13. And what is there more changeable and inconſtant then man? So many aſſaults that Satan gives us, ſo many dangers that beſet us, ſo many infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities that are in us, ſo many exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Apoſtates that make ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wrack of their faith; do they not give us cauſe enough to doubt? Yes verily, and to deſpair abſolutely, if we look no farther then to our ſelves: But <hi>the power of God is perfected in our weakneſs,</hi> 2 Cor. 12.19. If we be weak, he is ſtrong; if we be change<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, he's immutable: <hi>I have loved
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:170357:81"/> thee with an everlaſting love, and have therefore extended my loving kindneſs to thee,</hi> Jerem. 31.3. <hi>Thoſe whom he hath loved, he hath loved to the end;</hi> and <hi>the gifts and calling of God are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out repentance,</hi> Rom. 11.29. <hi>His foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation continues firm,</hi> 2 Tim. 2.19. <hi>He knows who are his,</hi> and none ſhall raviſh them out of his hands: and it is impoſſibile that his elect ſhould be ſeduced, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.24. but <hi>thoſe whom he hath foreknown, he hath prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinated, called, juſtified, and glorified,</hi> Rom. 8.29. This chain of his love is altogether inviolable; and therefore reſt thy ſelf upon his favourable power, and upon his unchangeable goodneſs, ſaying with <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 138. <hi>The Lord will perfect that which concerneth me; thy mercy, O Lord, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth for ever: forſake not the works of thine own hands: Surely goodneſs and mercy ſhall follow me all the dayes of my life, and I will dwell in the houſe of the Lord for ever.</hi> This aſſurance is the true humility which beats down the pride of man, that he may glorifie God: pride and preſumption are to be feared when we go about to rely
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:170357:82"/> upon our ſelves, when we ſacrifice to our own nets, and exalt the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of our vertues: but let not that man fear to glorifie himſelf, that ſeeks his glory in the ſhame of the croſs of Chriſt; that ſtrips himſelf of all other ornaments, to put on Chriſt; that celebrates not his own juſtice, but the compaſſions of God: <hi>I do not glorifie my ſelf becauſe I am juſt,</hi> ſaid St. <hi>Ambroſe, but becauſe I am redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: I will not glorifie my ſelf at all, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I am without ſin, but becauſe I have obtained pardon of my ſins: I will not glorifie my ſelf that I have profited any, but becauſe Chriſt is Advocate for me towards the Father,</hi> 1 Joh. 1.2. <hi>that he hath ſhed his blood for my ſake, and for me hath taſted of death; this is not arrogance, but faith. To preach and to publiſh that which thou haſt received, is not pride, but devotion,</hi> ſaid St. Auguſtine.</p>
            <p>And for concluſion, it is leaſt to be feared that this doctrine ſhould make men negligent, or be as a pillow un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der their elbowes, to make their ſouls ſleepy in the neglect of the means of ſalvation. St. <hi>Paul</hi> draws a quite contrary conſequence, when he ſaith,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:170357:82"/> 
               <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>Work out your ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with fear and trembling;</hi> and adds this for a reaſon; <hi>for it is God that works in you both the will and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance, according to his good pleaſure.</hi> Will you ſay then, that this belief makes men ſleepy, and choakes in their conſciences, both the duties of prayer, and the exerciſes of charity? contrarywiſe, there is not a ſharper ſpur to this acknowledgment, then the knowledge of the Love of God, and the aſſurance of his grace. Who hath ever ſeen fear produce a good action? And what is there in the world that is either fair or generous, which is not to be attributed to hope? It were a deviliſh malice, to be wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed becauſe God is good; to turn the back upon him, when he turns his face upon us; to flye him, becauſe he ſeek us; to change affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward him, becauſe his love is for ever unchangeable toward us; and becauſe he will give a kingdom in heaven for us, to caſt our ſelves into the way that leads to infernal pains. The children of God go another way; and from the faith and aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:170357:83"/> which they have of the love of their father, they enflame their loves the more to him, and feel themſelves the more obliged to his obedience. They fear to offend ſo good a Father; and being purchaſed by ſo excellent a price, they conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate their bodies and ſpirits to his glory. And as the ſick man to whom Phyſitians have given aſſurance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery, keeps himſelf from things that are contrary to his health, and takes more willingly the remedies that are ordained him; whereas he that deſpaires of his health abandons himſelf to his appetite: So the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man knowing that God will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part to him of his glory, goes by the way of ſanctity and good works, that he may attain to the other; and <hi>having ſo many fair promiſes, cleanſes himſelf from all pollution of fleſh and ſpirit, finiſhing the ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in the fear of God,</hi> 2 Cor. 7.1. So <hi>Daniel</hi> knew, that when the 70 years of the captivity were at an end, God ſhould deliver his people, and therefore about that time, he put himſelf upon prayer and faſting,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:170357:83"/> 
               <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.2, 3. So St. <hi>Paul, Act.</hi> 23.24, 31. had a promiſe for all thoſe that were with him in the ſhip, that none ſhould be loſt; but yet when he ſaw the Mariners ready to withdraw themſelves, he did not ſpare to tell them, that <hi>if they did not tarry with us, we could not be ſaved.</hi> The Pagans themſelves never entred into com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bats with more courage, then when they had their birds, or the entrails favourable: they never engaged in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a buſineſs with ſo much vigor, as when they were aſſured of ſucceſs by the anſwers of Oracles. We are called by the vocation of God, to the poſſeſſion of the heavenly <hi>Canaan:</hi> He promiſes us for the getting it, his conduct, favour, and aſſiſtance; ſo that with <hi>Job</hi> we may very well ſay, <hi>I ſhall ſee God.</hi> And what then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains, but that <hi>caſting down every burden, and the ſin that ſo eaſily enlaces us, we may purſue with conſtancy the courſe ſet before us:</hi> and traverſing all dangers, and going under hope againſt hope, we may <hi>have our eyes upon Jeſus Christ the author and finiſher of our faith;</hi> that ſo we may more and
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170357:84"/> more in his love, revive the ſtrength of ours; and recollect in him every day new vigor, until the time that from vertue to vertue, we may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear before his Sacred face, where receiving the Crown and heap of his bleſſings, we may glorifie him for ever; as to him appertains ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and glory from this time forth, and from generation to generation.

               <hi>IT is impoſsible to pleaſe God without faith,</hi> Heb. 11.6.<note place="margin">SERM.

All the view that conducts us to eternal ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, is faith. And therefore as in vain the Sun ſends forth his light, in vain does it enlighten ſo many tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in the Heavens, and diſcovers upon Earth ſo rich an embroidery of leaves and flowers, for thoſe that are without eyes: So as unprofitable
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170357:85"/> are the marveiles which the wiſdom of God hath diſplay'd in all this uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe, and the divine myſteries which it hath diſcovered in the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his holy word, for thoſe that are without faith. God complaines Eſai. 65. that <hi>in vain he hath ſtretcht out his hands to a rebellious and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting people:</hi> and St. <hi>Paul, Heb.</hi> 4.2. gives a reaſon why the word of preaching hath not profited the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the Jewes: and it is, <hi>becauſe it was not mingled with faith in thoſe that heard it. Who hath believed our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to whom hath the arm of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal been revealed?</hi> Iſai. 53.1. Light is the firſt and moſt excellent work of God, in the elementary world; the eye is the moſt admirable beauty of all the humane body: it is the joy of our life, the addreſs of our actions, and the cleereſt window of the ſoul: the eye and light of our ſoul is faith, without which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines in darkneſs, ignorant of the way of God, confuſed in all her acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and plunged in mourning and deſpair: and therefore it is alſo the chief gift of heavenly grace, the firſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170357:85"/> tract of the Image of God that is markt in our hearts, the firſt action of our ſpiritual life, and the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and origine of all other vertues. By this light <hi>Job</hi> acknowledges and diſcovers the eternal benefits which recompenſe his temporal loſſes; he finds ſpiritual ſweetneſs, which tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers the bitterneſs of his corporal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; he ſees and embraces the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durable felicity of the ſecond life, which reinforces his ſoul againſt the apprehenſions of death.</p>
            <p>For this cauſe we have ſo long in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted to deſcribe and repreſent to you the nature of this faith, by wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it out of ignorance, from the confuſion and uncertainty wherein they ſeek to fold it up, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw ſouls from the true ſpring of life, and divert it to the crackt ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterns of ſuperſtition; to engrave the lively tracts of it as deep in your ſouls, as <hi>Job</hi> deſired to have them imprinted in the hard rock, that ſo the deduction which we ſhall make you, after him, of the myſteries of your redemption, may not be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitful to you, but that being guided
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170357:86"/> by this divine and heavenly torch, you may there find that aſſurance, firmity and conſolation, that <hi>Joy ine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narrable and glorious,</hi> which is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for you in the midſt of ſo many evils and combats as the enemies of the truth of God do deliver and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for his Church.</p>
            <p>Before we come to a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular conſideration of the Redeemer, and of this life, reſurrection and glory, which he hath purchaſed for us by the price of his redemption; we muſt upon theſe words make ſome general remark, which may be proper to confirm us as much in the verity of our faith, as they will make us ſee that it is venerable for antiquity, and alwaies veritable and conſtant in her unity. We ſee the dolours of <hi>Job</hi> encreaſe againſt all other remedies, drawn either from hope of temporal things, or from any rules of the law; and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in one onely Jeſus Chriſt, ſeeking in the only benefit of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, his repoſe and hope; where he teaches us clearly, that the principal and ſpecial object of faith
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170357:86"/> hath at all times been the promiſe of the grace and ſalvation which was to be purchaſed by this Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and men: which holding and embracing, ſhe finds (and not till then) her repoſe and tranquilli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The whole Word of God is truly the proportioned object to th'extent of our faith; and according to the intelligence and approbation of the underſtanding, ſhe embraces it wholly, and can go no further: and in every thing, and every where, ſhe reputes God to be true, whether he command or forbid; whether he promiſe or threaten; whether he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct or correct: ſhe leads all her thoughts captive under obedience; ſhe receives all his commands with humility; ſhe keeps her ſelf to his prohibitions with fear; ſhe embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces his promiſes with affection: ſhe fears his threatnings, ſhe hearkens to his inſtructions, and profits by his corrections; for if faith doubt and go reeling in uncertainty of any one point of whatſoever is manifeſted in the Word of God, there will after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards need no great violence to
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170357:87"/> ſhake it in all other things, and to throw it head-long into infidelity: And therefore when we give for the principal object of faith, the promiſe of ſalvation and grace, we will not ſubtract it to other parts of the word, as leaving it indifferent, and every one to liberty of believing or miſ-believing at his fancy; but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariwiſe, knowing that all hath been brought to us not by the will of man, but by the inſpiration of the eternal ſpirit, which hath guided the tongues and pens of thoſe that have announced and left written this holy word; we maintain that the verity of it muſt be wholly and in every part both heard and received, with the like reverence. But we ſay more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, that as the waters of the Sea are for divers ends ſpread abroad, and go creeping through an infinity of chanels, over and under the face of the earth, yet in ſuch ſort, that at laſt they return all into the boſom of the Ocean from whence they had their birth: ſo we ſay, that in the book of Scripture, divers matters, hiſtories, examples, judgements,
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170357:87"/> threatnings, laws, inſtructions and exhortations, which like little ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers <hi>rejoyce the City of our God,</hi> and ſerve to divers uſes in the Church: But after all, Jeſus Chriſt is the mark whereat all aim, the Centre whither all return, and guide our faith in him to find and obtain reſt: So <hi>Moſes and the Prophets give their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony,</hi> Luk. 24.27. and <hi>the end of the Law is Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Rom. 10.4. and to this intent ſpeaks St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. that <hi>he will know nothing but Jeſus Christ and him crucified;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that is the ſummary and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal end of all the knowledge of the Scriptures; which faith not onely beholds as a thing to be conſented to; but embraces it, as the only ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject where to find ſalvation and life. Certainly, faith believes the creation of the world, the genealogy of the fathers, the confuſion of tongues in <hi>Babel,</hi> the captivity of Iſrael in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> the exploits of the Judges and Kings given to the people of God for Liberators: and from all theſe things there may be gathered divers inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions for this life: but to find in this
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170357:88"/> recital the means of our reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, of the remiſſion of ſins, and the eternal glory, it is not poſſible, becauſe it is not in any of theſe properly. Where the Eternal offers and preſents the gifts of his heavenly grace, that is, a Word of God which he pronounced to <hi>Adam</hi> with his own mouth, after he had tranſgreſt the commandment; <hi>Thou ſhalt dye the death; in the ſweat of thy brow ſhalt thou eat thy bread,</hi> Gen. 3.19. Theſe things were conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Law and Word of God: all theſe fearful menaces which the friends of <hi>Job</hi> with ſo much prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive denounced to the hypocrites and wicked: but theſe are ſo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getting or keeping up faith, (which as 'tis requiſite, ſhould be accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied with peace and conſolation) that contrariwiſe they put the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience into trouble, they fill the ſinful ſoul with fear; and in ſtead of giving us acceſs to God, go chaſing and baniſhing us behind his face; as we read of the people of Iſrael, who not able to abide the thundring voice of the Eternal, (giving his
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170357:88"/> Law upon the mountain) ſtood afar off, and ſaid to <hi>Moſes, Exod.</hi> 20.19. <hi>Speak thou with us, and we will hear thee; but let not God ſpeak with us, for fear we dye.</hi> This very part of the word that commands obedience, and preſcribes a rule for works, propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing bleſſing and life to thoſe that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it; <hi>Do this, and thou ſhalt live,</hi> Luk. 10.28. <hi>Whoſoever doth theſe things, ſhall live by them,</hi> Levit. 18.5. is not that where our faith reſts; becauſe as it promiſes life to the obſervers, ſo it denounces <hi>male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction againſt all thoſe that do not abide in all the words of the Law to fulfil them:</hi> And thus our conſcience, guilty of many tranſgreſſions, cannot find nor affirm her aſſurance, nor ſeek for remiſſion of ſins, where there is nothing preſented but wrath and judgment: And therefore the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and in that which he writes to the <hi>Gala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians,</hi> retires our faith from the Law, and tells us openly, that <hi>the Law is not of faith,</hi> Gal. 3.12. that <hi>all they that are of the works of the Law, are under the curſe,</hi> Gal. 3.10, 11.
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170357:89"/> that the Law was not given to quic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, but contrary, that it is <hi>the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of death and of condemnation;</hi> none being able to be juſtified before God, by the works of the Law; declaring with <hi>David, thoſe to be bleſſed to whom God imputes juſtice without works,</hi> Pſal. 32.1, 2. Nevertheleſs it ceaſes not to ſerve faith, becauſe by it comes the knowledge of ſin; and that <hi>it ſerves as a School-maſter to lead us to Christ,</hi> Rom. 3.23. <hi>in whom we are freely juſtified by the grace of him, by the redemption which is in Jeſus Chriſt, whom God hath propoſed a mediator by faith in his blood;</hi> by whom the remiſſion of ſin is announced, to the end, that <hi>in whatſoever we could not be juſtified by the Law, whoſoever believes might be juſtified by him,</hi> Act. 13.39. For <hi>to him all the Prophets give teſtimony, that whoſoever ſhall believe in him, ſhall have remiſsion of ſins by his name,</hi> Act. 10.43. Hither it is properly that our faith is invited: <hi>Whoſoever is thirſty, let him come to me and drink,</hi> Joh. 7.37. <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy loden, and I will refreſh you,</hi> Matth. 11.28. So that this <hi>Goſpel of
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170357:89"/> peace,</hi> this <hi>word of reconciliation, mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of ſpirit,</hi> and of life, <hi>power of God unto ſalvation to all that believe,</hi> Rom. 1.16. Which opens to us the Abyſſes of compaſſions, of love, grace, and the good pleaſure of God, which deduces to us the coming, the incarnation, the ſuffrances, the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and the death of the Redeemer of the world, and which repreſents to us the Holy Spirit, applying and ſealing by the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel and the Sacraments, theſe divine and heavenly benefits in our ſouls, and rendring us aſſured of our recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with God, of the abolition of our offences, of the imputation of the juſtice of Chriſt, and of the gift of heavenly life. The Goſpel is <hi>the word of life,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 10.8. It looks at the whole word of God, but it embraces only his good will: It approves all his truth, but it runs only after his gratuity; and then 'tis beſt pleaſed, and content, when both are met in Chriſt, in whom gratuity and verity are met, <hi>juſtice and peace have kiſſed each other,</hi> Pſal. 85.11. by whom <hi>the gratuity of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170357:90"/> God is multiplied upon us, and his truth endures for ever,</hi> Pſal. 117.2. We do not then reject any part of the word, nor we do not tear the faith in pieces; but in this general object, we obſerve what is moſt proper, and moſt particularly belongs to it, by reaſon of the differing parts of it. Be then the Word of God a Paradiſe to the faithful ſoul; but ſo, as among ſo many fruits of different taſt and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, ſhe may find one tree of life that may fully ſatisfie the hunger of juſtice, that ſhe ſo ſeeks for: let the Scripture be her Orchard; but yet let there be one apple-tree whoſe ſhadow ſhe deſires ſitting down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it, and the fruit ſweet to her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late: let the truth of God be her garden of aromatique drugs; but let there be one <hi>Roſe of Sharon,</hi> whoſe ſweet ſmell may recover her fainting heart, and which ſhe may put in her boſome, no otherwiſe then <hi>a bundle of myrrhe,</hi> Cant. 1.13. He knows well enough that his Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is living.</p>
            <p>But if the Goſpel be the particular object of faith, from whence ſhall
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170357:90"/> we ſay that <hi>Job</hi> learned this ſcience, and from whence he could draw the foundations of an aſſurance ſo firm, ſince this was not but many ages af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death, that the Goſpel was publiſht to the world, or that the Saviour of the world was come to accompliſh the work of our redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption? <hi>The Law and the Prophets endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red till John; but ſince his time, the Kingdom of God is Evangelized;</hi> Luk. 16.16. <hi>Many Kings and Prophets have deſired to ſee the things which were ſeen,</hi> when Jeſus Chriſt converſt in the world, <hi>and they have not ſeen them,</hi> Luk. 10.24. And therefore Jeſus Chriſt prefers the <hi>least that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Goſpel, before the greateſt that were under the Law:</hi> St. <hi>John</hi> pointed at him with his hand, and ſhewed him to the World, to be <hi>the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins;</hi> for which cauſe he was raiſed above the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; and becauſe he had not ſeen nor ſhew'd the glory and vertue which followed his death and his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, he was therefore ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Apoſtles: And St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that <hi>the grace which hath been given us
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:170357:91"/> in Jeſus Christ, from eternal times, is now manifeſted by the apparition of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who hath deſtroyed death, and put into light both life and immortality by the Goſpel:</hi> It ſeems then that this myſtery of our redemption hath been hidden from precedent ages, and that the ancient Fathers have had nothing but ſhadows and figures of things that were to come. And yet Jeſus Chriſt himſelf gives this teſtimony to <hi>Abraham,</hi> that <hi>he deſired to ſee this day of his, and hath ſeen it, and rejoyced,</hi> Joh. 8.56. and St. <hi>Peter,</hi> 1 Pet. 1.10. that <hi>the Prophets have enquired and made diligent ſearch, concerning the ſalvation of ſouls,</hi> the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of faith; and by the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick ſpirit in them, have declared the ſufferances which were to come to Jeſus Chriſt, and the joyes which were to follow them: And for this reaſon it is, that the Son of God ſayes, <hi>He had the teſtimony of Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> and that the <hi>Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures</hi> of the old Teſtament <hi>bare wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of him,</hi> Joh. 5.39.</p>
            <p>To know then how that muſt be underſtood, to reſolve us in this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170357:91"/> of contrariety, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin our undermining at the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Papiſtical errors, touching the ſtate of the ſouls of the Fathers deceaſed before the coming of Chriſt; let us learn then from this confeſſion of faith, ſo fair, ſo firm, ſo clear as it can be in the noon day of the Goſpel, that we have no other faith, nor other means of ſalvation, then what the ancient Patriarchs had before us; and that the ancient Covenant contracted with them, in the ſubſtance and truth, is the ſame thing with the new one contracted with us, that are fallen into theſe later times: all the difference which is in them, conſiſting only in the order and the means of the diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; which according to the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of times, hath made it aſſume divers viſages: for as the Apoſtle, Heb. 1.1, 2. <hi>God hath heretofore many times, and after many ſorts, ſpoken to the fathers by the Prophets; and in theſe later times by his Son Jeſus Christ.</hi> Where he ſeems to diſtinguiſh the times by the coming of the Son of God, betwixt the preceding ages, and thoſe that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170357:92"/> were to come after. The firſt part hath had divers ſeaſons and divers manners, according to which this diſpenſation hath been ordered: The firſt ſeaſon is counted from the fall of <hi>Adam</hi> unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> during which we had no declaration more expreſs of this eternal alliance of God with men, then that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in few words, but of an high and full ſignification: <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall bruiſe the head of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent,</hi> Gen. 3.15. upon which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, confirmed, declared and enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the uſage of ſacrifices, and carried from hand to hand, and from father to ſon, during all the firſt age of the world, this faith was ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the hope of the faithful founded. In the ſecond ſeaſon, from <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> during which <hi>Job</hi> lived (a true Son of <hi>Abraham,</hi> both according to the fleſh and to the promiſe) this general promiſe was (as it were) reſtrained in the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily and poſterity of this Holy Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch; when God made this alli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with him, that <hi>he would be their God, and they his children;</hi> and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170357:92"/> to him, that from him ſhould go forth the Redeemer of the World, when he ſaid, that <hi>in his ſeed all the Nations of the World ſhould be bleſſed,</hi> Geneſ. 12. giving him beſide the ſacrifices, the particular ſeal of the circumciſion, as <hi>a ſign of the ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of faith,</hi> Rom. 4.11. The third was from <hi>Moſes</hi> to the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; where, in a more eſpecial and ample manner, God was pleaſed to inſtruct his people, expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and confirming his Covenant unto them, after divers faſhions; in which are remarkable two principal parts, having reference each to other, and ordained one for the love of the other: Like the two Cheru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bims, who being placed one right againſt the other, and extending their wings one toward the other, did both of them look toward the propitiatory, <hi>Exod.</hi> 25.20. the one was the Law, promiſing life and everlaſting benediction, under the condition of a moſt perfect obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his commands: A condition impoſſible to corrupted nature, <hi>whoſe imaginations were nothing but evil at all
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170357:93"/> times:</hi> and yet very neceſſary and uſeful, to make men know the duty wherein they were obliged, to make them ſenſible of weakneſs, and to make them comprehend the horrour of that condemnation into which their tranſgreſſions had precipitated them; by that means to conduct them to the ſecond part of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, which was all of it purely Evangelical; as that which under di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers figures and ceremonies did re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent mans reconciliation to God, and his plenary deliverance by the ranſom of that infinite merit of the ſacrifice of the death and paſſion of Chriſt. After this, in the fulneſs of time, came the great Redeemer of our ſoules, who aboliſhed the firſt means, that he might eſtabliſh the ſecond; aboliſh'd (I ſay) not wholly, but in part; not in the ſubſtance, but in the accidents: For as for the firſt part, he exacts no more as it were by force of maledictions that perfect obedience of the Law; but ſupplying the defects of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture by the abundant effuſion of his ſpirit of grace, he draws from
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:170357:93"/> ſanctified hearts a voluntary obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience: And in the ſecond, he hath cauſed the body to ſucceed the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, the truth the figures, the thing the ſignes; all theſe things ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been fulfilled in the death of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>And from hence may we eaſily comprehend the difference that there is betwixt the new Covenant and the old; between the faith of the Fathers that lived under the Law, and theirs that live under the Goſpel. For it is the ſame thing in ſubſtance; Having God for the Author, his grace and mercy for the cauſe, and the ſatisfaction of Chriſt for the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritorious foundation; The ſame things promiſed, grace and glory: God is to us both, <hi>a Sun and a Shield; he gives both grace and glory; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds no good thing from ſuch as wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him:</hi> Diſtributed in general by the ſame means, and the preaching of the word; <hi>Hearken, and your ſoules ſhall live,</hi> Iſai. 55.3. the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Sacraments: <hi>He that ſhall not be circumcized, ſhall be cut off,</hi> Gen. 17.14. and the inward work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170357:94"/> of the ſpirit of God, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 59.21. <hi>My ſpirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put into thy mouth, ſhall not depart from thy mouth, nor from the mouth of thy ſeed, nor from the mouth of thy ſeeds ſeed, from henceforth and for ever:</hi> Aiming at the ſame end, to wit, ſalvation and life eternal. But as to the accidents, and in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of diſpenſation, there is no ſmall difference. For in the Goſpel, the manifeſtation of doctrine is more clear, expreſs, and efficacious; as much more clear, as accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are before propheſies; and things preſent, then things which are as yet hid in the length of ages to come: and ſo much the more clear, in that at this day of exterior mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtation, hath been added a greater abundance of the Spirits interior light, according as it was propheſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28. <hi>And it ſhall come to paſs afterward, that I will pour out my ſpirit upon all fleſh, and your ſons and your daughters ſhall propheſie; your old men ſhall dream dreams, your young men ſhall ſee viſions:</hi> ſo that whereas they of old ſaw Jeſus Chriſt but under ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170357:94"/> and images of what was to come; we hold him as come already, and look upon him as crucified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes. To this may be added, their Covenant was contracted by the mediation of <hi>Moſes;</hi> ours, by that of Chriſt: The old Covenant was confined to one corner of the world, and tyed to one family; the new one hath reach'd to the ends of the earth, and hath embraced the Nations: The old one laſted but for a time, whereas the new one ſhall not termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate but by the end of ages.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Jeſus Chriſt is the ſame yeſterday, to day, and for ever,</hi> Heb. 13.8. This <hi>is the Lamb ſlain before the foundation of the world,</hi> Revel. 13.8. 'Tis he that is <hi>a light to the nations, and the ſalvation of God unto the ends of the earth:</hi> in waiting for him, thoſe of old found their conſolation, as we have ours in ſeeing him: and the odor of his ſacrifice expanding it ſelf as well over the fore-going as following ages, hath reſtored thoſe ſouls who before or ſince have put their whole truſt in him: Wherefore although wee ſee thoſe of old in rudiments
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170357:95"/> which are ſeemingly groſs, let us not the leſſe value their faith, who for having the leſs of clarity, have not the leſs of certainty. Certainly, propheſie was like a candle giving light in an obſcure place; the Law like the dawning of the day, or the Star of the morning; and the Goſpel like the clear noon: But all theſe lights, though differing in clarity, have been enough to make us ſee and follow the wayes of ſalvation, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.19. And though it ſeem to us, that we ſee no more promiſed to the people of Iſrael, and their Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs, then a <hi>Canaan</hi> flowing with milk and hony, and with a thouſand ſweets of temporal bleſſings; yet let us not think that they ſtopt there, or that they did not with <hi>Job</hi> raiſe their ſouls, and carry up their deſires to things ſpiritual, to that inward peace, and never-decaying glory, which was repreſented to them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe ſhadows of an earthly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. For in whatſoever was here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore offered and preſented to them, they ſtill caſt their eyes on Jeſus Chriſt the promiſed Meſſias, <hi>in
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170357:95"/> whom all Gods promiſes are yea and amen,</hi> 2 Corinth. 1.20. The conſideration of whom, would by no means ſuffer them to dwell upon the tranſitory ſweetneſſes of this world; his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom being repreſented to them by Propheſies, not as a carnal or world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one, but as one altogether celeſtial and ſpiritual. <hi>The Scepter</hi> (ſaid <hi>Jacob</hi> to his ſons) <hi>ſhall not be taken from Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah, nor the Law-giver from betwixt his feet, till Silo come,</hi> Gen. 40. That is to ſay, The ſeed of the woman, the man to be born without a Father; and to him the people ſhall aſſemble themſelves: He was to come forth of <hi>Judah,</hi> but at the time that he was to come, <hi>Judah</hi> muſt loſe the Sce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter; not then to rule or ſignorize in <hi>Judah:</hi> for if he were to raiſe <hi>Judah</hi> above the Nations, he ſhould not then be the hope of his people, ſince his coming was to vanquiſh and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jugate them: but to him all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were to run, and to offer him vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary obedience, becauſe under his yoke they ſhould come to ſeek their liberty; becauſe he ſhall raigne over their ſouls, and conduct them
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170357:96"/> with a rod of comfort, delivering them from the bonds of ſin, and the tyranny of Satan, whoſe head he ſhall bruiſe, and take away his Empire. So likewiſe when the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets ſpeak of the deliverance of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> of the peoples return into the land of promiſe, and the re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of the Temple; preſently you ſee them tranſported with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Kingdom of this great <hi>Meſsias,</hi> of the deliverance of the ſouls of the true temple, which is the Church: As if they would teach the people, that the poſſeſſion of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan,</hi> and all the contentment depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding thereon, were but ſhadows not to be truſted to; their felicity not conſiſting, to live, to govern, and reigne here below, but to ſerve God, to be govern'd by him, as that by the Scepter of his word, and effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of his ſpirit, he might reign in us, and be fully obeyed: So ſaith <hi>Eſai,</hi> that <hi>the branch of the Lord ſhall be beautiful and glorious; and the fruit of the earth ſhall be excellent and comely for them that are eſcaped of Iſrael,</hi> Iſai. 42.3, 4. But with what glory? It
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:170357:96"/> is (and he adds) that <hi>he that is left in Zion, and he that remains in Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, ſhall be called holy; and thoſe that ſhall be in Jeruſalem ſhall all be written to life, when the Lord ſhall have waſht a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the filth of the daughters of Zion, and ſhall have purged the blood of Jeruſalem from the midſt thereof, by the ſpirit of judgment, and by the ſpirit of burning:</hi> and in the 11 Chapter he ſhews, that the gifts he hath received from above, to communicate to the world, are all ſpiritual, when he ſaith, Iſai. 11.2. <hi>The ſpirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him, the ſpirit of wiſdom and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, the ſpirit of counſel and might, the ſpirit of knowledge and of the fear of the Lord:</hi> He ſaith moreover, that <hi>he will bring his people from the North and from the South, and that the earth ſhall be too narrow to contain them;</hi> that <hi>Kings and Queens ſhall be their nurſing fathers and nurſing mothers:</hi> But this is not to promiſe a temporal Kingdom, but to repreſent an arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of all Nations to his Church; and of their Kings themſelves, under whoſe protection ſhe ſhould abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly proſper. And here you may
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:170357:97"/> ſee the difference, which is betwixt the advancements which the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal promiſes to Kings, and he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance which he prepares for his Son into the world. Behold how he ſpeaks to <hi>Cyrus, Iſai.</hi> 45.12, 3. <hi>I have taken thee by thy right band, that thou might'st make the Nations thy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and that I might weaken the reins of their Kings: I will break the gates of braſs, and bruiſe the bolts of iron, and give thee the hidden treaſures.</hi> But when he ſpeaks of the Meſſias, <hi>We have ſeen him grow up as a tender plant; and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comelineſs; and when we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him: He is deſpiſed and rejected of men; a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with griefs, and we hid as it were our faces from him; he was deſpiſed, and we eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him not.</hi> And after, he ſhewes why he was come into this ſad and abject form, becauſe <hi>he hath born our griefs, and carried our ſorrows: he was wounded for our tranſgreſsions, he was bruiſed for our iniquities,</hi> Iſai. 53.4, 5. <hi>The price which hath purchaſed our peace, was put upon him; and by his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therings,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170357:97"/> we were healed:</hi> As <hi>Daniel</hi> more openly declares, that he ſhould come to <hi>put an end to diſloyalty, to purge iniquity,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Dan. 9.24.</note> 
               <hi>and to bring juſtice into the world.</hi> This is that which was ſo clearly repreſented to them by the ceremony of the ſacrifices, where ſuch things were offered that could not have an entire and proper vertue for the waſhing of the ſoul, but did onely look after, and ſearch their perfection in the full and entire ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction which Jeſus Chriſt hath rendered to the juſtice of God his Father, by the ſacrifice of the Croſs. And thus the faithful inſtructed by all theſe means, have ever teſtified that the attendance of their ſouls hath carried it ſelf higher then the outſide of ſignes, and of the tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient benefit of theſe temporal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: For <hi>Job</hi> declares it not only here in formal termes, but likewiſe, as the Apoſtle ſhewes, in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebr.</hi> Chap. 11.9, 10. The Patriarchs have <hi>dwelt as ſtrangers in the Land of Promiſe,</hi> as if it had not belonged to them; dwelling under Tents, and poſſeſſing nothing there
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170357:98"/> but their ſepulchres: to let us ſee, that it was not properly that earth, which being dead they could not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, that was given for a reward of their faith; but that <hi>they looked for a City which had a foundation, whereof God himſelf was the Architect and buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der:</hi> even that God that had alwaies been their buckler, and was alſo for ever, and after death it ſelf their abundant reward: A reward which <hi>Jacob</hi> waited for during all the courſe of his life; and touching it as with his finger at the point of death, He cried out; <hi>Lord, I have waited for thy ſalvation,</hi> Gen. 49.18. A reward for which the Prophet <hi>David</hi> rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, Pſal. 17.15. <hi>I will behold thy face in righteouſneſs; I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake with thy likeneſs:</hi> which goes beyond this life, as himſelf teſtifies, when he aſſures that <hi>the death of the children of God is precious in his ſight,</hi> Pſal. 116.15. and hath made this holy and heavenly light ſo reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and ſparkling, that even <hi>Bala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am,</hi> though a wicked Prophet, ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to the Covenant, and enemy of Gods people, ſeeing afar off this
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170357:98"/> Star of <hi>Jacob,</hi> and this King that ſhould render him bleſſed, cryes out, Numb. 23.10. <hi>Let me dye the death of the righteous, and let my laſt end be like his:</hi> which without doubt he could never have deſired, if he had not had hope of good after death; and if death, as a Pagan ſaith, had made an end of all things, and of it ſelf too.</p>
            <p>The faith then that we profeſs, &amp; the profeſſion of the hope where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to we ſtick, is no new thing: It is the faith of the fathers, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds with knowledge, and receives with aſſurance, the grace that is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the merit of the Lord Jeſus, and the eternal benefits of the glory which is to come. Let the Papiſts no more alleadge the Fathers to us: <hi>Job</hi> and the Patriarchs are more ancient then all the Fathers that they can al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leadge: let them no more produce their enfumed titles, nor the walls of their Churches, which time hath covered with Ivy and Moſs; theſe are but feeble arguments to combat with a faith which hath been from the beginning, and from the firſt
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170357:99"/> ages, alwaies the ſame, until this preſent: we care not if our walls be new, ſo that our doctrine be ancient: little doth it concern us what the ſchool-men ergat in their ſchools; the very Horſe-courſers of heavenly truth, which they have pulled out of her throne, to make her a ſlave to temporal commodities, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate her to the profit of a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt gain; only to this end, that we may appear merchants upon the ſteps of theſe ancient Patriarchs, who have had teſtimony to have <hi>pleaſed God;</hi> and who following the faith of <hi>Job,</hi> of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> we may alſo have place with them in the Kingdom of Heaven.</p>
            <p>Only, my brethren, let us have a care of this, that the faith of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, which amidſt the ſhadows of the Law, and the dusky obſcurities of theſe groſs rudiments, hath been ſo lively, ſo firm, and ſo conſtant, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce not a condemnation againſt our infidelity; of us (I ſay) on whom the later times are fallen, to whom the ſaving grace hath clearly appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to whom (the veil being taken
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170357:99"/> off) without ſhadow or <hi>aenigma,</hi> the myſtery of the redemption is in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs terms repreſented; the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the reſurrection manifeſted; and the unſpeakable joy of the glory to come diſcovered: Thoſe that ſaw theſe things but obſcurely, and afar off, have been nevertheleſs, ſo far toucht and raviſht with ſo much force, by the excellency of them, that they have contemned their country, their pleaſures, the world, and their own lives, to follow them: And we in the midſt of the light of ſo great a knowledge, to keep our ſelves to the leaſt of theſe periſhable goods, are but too ready to forſake thoſe excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies: And where are thoſe at this day, in this clear light of the Goſpel, that like <hi>Abraham,</hi> would ſuffer to ſee themſelves exiled from their dear Country, or ſevered from their friends and their parentage, and go they know not whither, to follow the vocation of God? <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.8. Where are they that like <hi>Moſes</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the greatneſs of the world? <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to be called the ſon of the daughter of Pharaoh, chuſing rather to be afflicted
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:170357:100"/> with the people of God, then for a time to enjoy the delights of ſin; eſteeming the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probry of Chriſt greater riches then the treaſures that were in Egypt?</hi> Or thoſe who with <hi>David</hi> love rather to have one favourable regard from the face of God, then the favour of Kings, and the abundance of the goods of this world, and to be a ſimple por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the Houſe of God, then to dwell with honour in the taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of the wicked? Or elſe thoſe who with <hi>Job,</hi> after the loſs of their goods, the deſolation of their fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, and in the very arms of death, are ready to glorifie God, and eſteem themſelves bleſt to poſſeſſe his grace, and wait for the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his glory? Where ſhall we ſeek them in this perverſe age, where there are many that are more ready to ſell their Country, their Brethren, and Parents, for a little ſilver, then to forſake them for the glory of God? Where this rage of getting goods, this infernal fury of avarice, ſo poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes the greateſt part of men, that are ſo far from quitting their riches to follow Chriſt, that contrarily
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170357:100"/> they do not ſtick to truck with Jeſus Chriſt for riches; and do willingly leave the certain hope of the glory of heaven, for the uncertain promiſe of ſome honour, or ſome command in the world, though but for three dayes; and where at laſt, in ſtead of the joy which the children of God reſent in their tribulations, and the actions of thanks which they render to God in the midſt of his correcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, we ſee painted upon the faces of the moſt modeſt, a conſternation and a ſadneſs, which witneſſes that we regard his fatherly rods with a wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed eye, and that theſe <hi>light afflictions</hi> do ſend us to deaths door, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the <hi>Weight of Juſtice,</hi> which they carry, nor the <hi>glory</hi> that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes them, can any waies awaken nor cheer up our hearts: And what is this, but that faith goes by little and little failing and falling to the ground? that we have no more but an appearance of piety, and a ſhew of godlineſs, but have renounced the force of it: we believe not in the promiſes of God, and Atheiſme is but too far inſinuated into the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170357:101"/> part of ſouls that are ſlaves to the periſhable <hi>Mammon,</hi> that love your pleaſures more then God; unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to have an immortal ſpirit, that ſet your affections upon things that have not ſo much honour as to be mortal. Of all that which you ſow to the fleſh, what do you reap, but corruption? What can you hope for after the contempt of the <hi>heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gift, whereof you have taſted?</hi> Of this <hi>power of the world to come,</hi> which you have <hi>known;</hi> of this <hi>ſpirit of grace,</hi> which you have <hi>grieved;</hi> of this <hi>blood of the Covenant,</hi> which you <hi>tread un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der foot?</hi> but an <hi>horrible expectation of the judgement of God, a fervour of fire conſuming his adverſaries,</hi> and a ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance as much redoubled as the knowledge which you have had, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders you more wicked and inexcuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble?</p>
            <p>You then (faithful ſouls) to whom God hath given better inſpirations, at this noyſe and report of the faith of your fore-fathers, awaken ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly this drowzineſs of your own; turn away your hearts from the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity

            <p>
               <hi>Babylon</hi> was a City ſituate in the field of <hi>Shinar</hi> in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> North from the Land of <hi>Judea;</hi> which as it was the Imperial Seat of <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar</hi> (whoſe victorious army was by Gods avenging juſtice ſtretched many Kingdoms beſides <hi>Judea,</hi>) ſo for its magnificence was it ſtiled <hi>the glory of Nations, the beauty and pride of the Chaldeans,</hi> Eſai. 13.19.</p>
            <p>God ſometimes proſpers the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whileſt he ſuffers his own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to lye under oppreſſion: theſe have the glory of their houſes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed, and have riches in poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whileſt the other are evil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated of Tyrants; and <hi>they that hate them are Lords over them.</hi> Babylon

               <hi>ſits as a Queen, and ſeeth no ſorrow,</hi> whileſt <hi>Judea is gone into captivity, and her beauty into the enemies hand.</hi> But whileſt correction reclaimes the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Saint, <hi>the proſperity of the wicked deſtroyes the ſinner.</hi> Gods outward fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours (though they be ſilken cords) ſeldom draw the wicked to goodneſs. <hi>Babylon</hi> is beautiful, rich, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous, yet <hi>Babylon</hi> is ſtill a City of confuſion; and ſo, not more for the confuſion of tongues there, <hi>Gen.</hi> 11.4, 7. then for their confuſion both in Religion and Government.</p>
            <p>For the former, the Sacred Story tells us, a general deluge of water had overflown the whole earth: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the former inundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, imprinted in men a fear of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: and though God had paſt an Act of Grace for ſecurity, and placed his bow in the clouds, to be a Sacrament to the world, that he would never deſtroy it ſo again; yet their jealouſies and fears prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted them to new inventions of their own, for their own ſecurity: a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their own device ſhall be more truſted in, then the word, promiſe,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170357:106"/> and ordinance of God. But how juſtly did divine vengeance confound their tongues and hands to a diviſion among themſelves, whoſe impious attempts had made a diviſion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt themſelves &amp; Heaven? When the wickedneſs of men oppoſeth it ſelf to Heaven, Gods judgments up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their wickedneſs ſends amongſt them diviſions and confuſions. If man be confederate againſt his God, God (as in the confuſion of <hi>Babel</hi>) ſends a diviſion not ſo much among the tongues, as the hearts of men. No peace with home-born ſubjects, either by the free obligation of love, or by the ſtrict tye of allegiance, ſo ſtrong; no union with our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours ſo firm, which upon our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon breach of faith with Heaven, God ſuffers not, either for the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of a State, or the diſturbance of a Church, to conclude in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous rupture, an unnatural diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affection. Our peace with man, is grounded upon our peace with God. <hi>If God be with us, who can be againſt us?</hi> was both an Apoſtles triumph, and an Emperours motto. But if we be
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170357:106"/> not with God, God will not be with us; and if God be againſt us, he will (as by ſad experience we have found it true) ſend amongſt us diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and confuſion.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>[Babylon]</hi> a City of confuſion, for their confuſion both in Religion and Government. It is the obſervation of Antiquity, that (after the Languages confuſion) through the neglect of words, the ignorance of God got ſtrength, and ſent forth a fruitful progeny of falſe Gods, to the number of their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippers. <hi>Succoth Benoth</hi> was the Idol-god choſen and worſhipped by the <hi>Babylonians,</hi> 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 17.36. But though they had forſaken the Lord, and ſerved Idols, they ſtaid not here; they will have their glorious refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation; a monſtrous golden image is ſet up, and every one (without li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of conſcience to any) muſt fall down before it, when the muſick gives them warning, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.15.</p>
            <p>It was the fault of the Jewes, that they deſired to be <hi>like the Nations.</hi> And Chriſtians (I fear) have learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed too much of Heatheniſh Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170357:107"/> to alter, not their form of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip only, but their very Creed too.</p>
            <p>It is obſerved in Diſputes, that <hi>one abſurdity granted, a thouſand follow.</hi> Men run to errour without end, when they have once departed from the truth; and that miſchief which (at firſt) they could not think on without horrour, they can (at laſt) commit without remorſe.</p>
            <p>Yet one ſtep further; even <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavel</hi> himſelf could ſay, that the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God his due, is the cauſe of the greatneſs of any State: and that there is a God, is the unanimous language of the whole world, even ſince the confuſion of tongues: yet upon this principle have been built more <hi>Babels</hi> of errours, then there have been Nations derived from the languages confuſion. For though Nature hath enſtamped upon the ſoul of man the certainty of a Deity; yet the deſignes of policy have ſo miſrepreſented him to mens conceits, as 'tis hard to ſay whether they were more happy in a dark ignorance, or miſerable in a doubtful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge. How often have men (for
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170357:107"/> the furtherance of their deſignes) as if they came into the world, not to receive rules of faith, but to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them, undertaken to be Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchs in the Art of Faith, and to trick up anew (each men after his fancy) that great work of Religion, which derives its accompliſhment from God alone?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Babylon</hi> then (the place of their captivity) muſt needs add to the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery of the captives, if we look no further then the beauty, pride, riches and glory of <hi>Babylon;</hi> yet to be ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptive amidſt all this, were but to ſtarve in the midſt of plenty, to be naked in a rich wardrop, to be bound in fetters of gold, and to kneel in the duſt before a throne of glory: Fetters of gold are but fetters; and the Peaſant that from his loamy cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage is carried priſoner to a ſtately Caſtle, though for his homely ſtall, he hath the exchange of a Princely building; yet he changes his golden liberty for iron ſhackles.</p>
            <p>Theſe Jews whom the Kings of <hi>Babylon</hi> honoured moſt, were at the beſt but captive Governours. When
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170357:108"/> the King of <hi>France</hi> was here in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> King <hi>Edward</hi> who had taken him captive, honoured him with all Princely entertainments; yet ſtill was he penſive: and being deſired to be merry, anſwered, <hi>How ſhall I ſing ſongs in a ſtrange land?</hi> To be encir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cled with ten thouſand bared heads, and to be ſerved on the bended knees of the mighty men, and to want no ceremonies befitting Majeſty; yet to be a captive, a priſoner; this clouds the brightneſs of the Sun, and ſhuts it up again in darkneſs. All honour, beauty, riches, and what elſe deſira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, without liberty, are but glorious Pageants: 'tis liberty that gives life and vigour, and ſets a price upon all things elſe: this is the true Elixir, that turneth all things into gold; and gold it ſelf, without it, reſolves to vileſt earth. Had they been but Tributaries to that uncircumciſed power, their necks might with ſome eaſe have born that yoke of ſubjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; whileſt they had this happineſs left, their liberty to repair to the Sanctuary, and to viſit Gods Holy Temple; but now <hi>Ichabod, their glory
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170357:108"/> is departed;</hi> their land enjoyes her Sabbaths, but they may enjoy nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it nor them: <hi>By the waters of [Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon] they ſate down,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But that's not all; for ſecondly, they are <hi>conſtrained to dwell in Meſech,</hi> and to <hi>have their habitation in the Tents of Kedar;</hi> they are captives <hi>in [Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon;]</hi> where, as almoſt every day brings forth a new Deity and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: ſo all occaſions are ſought for their deſtruction. New decrees and ordinances lay as cloſe ſiege to their ſoules, as formerly did their conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring forces to their fortified walls; that their ſouls and conſciences might be alike captivated as their bodies: So as in <hi>Babylon</hi> they are ſtill but as in a larger priſon, or a belea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guered City; and ſo much the more dangerous, as the aſſaults to the ſoul are more dreadful then all violence to the body.</p>
            <p>But they were <hi>open enemies that did them this diſhonour;</hi> and <hi>profeſſed ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries, that magnifying themſelves against them,</hi> led them into captivity; and therefore the more tolerable, from whom they could expect no
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170357:109"/> better; but that <hi>thou my companion, and mine own familiar friend, with whom I took ſweet counſel, and walked together in the houſe of God as friends, ſhould do me this miſchief;</hi> this was a temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtrong enough to have provoked the ſpirit of <hi>David,</hi> to have wiſhed paſſionately what he ſpake Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tically; <hi>Let death come haſtily upon them, and let them go down quick into hell; for wickedneſs is in their dwellings and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them.</hi> Whileſt theſe, like melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly men, betake themſelves to the rivers ſide, whoſe ſoft murmurs bear conſort with their ſad tempers; <hi>by the waters of Babylon ſit we down, and weep, when we remember thee, O Zion.</hi> And ſo I have done with the firſt thing, the place of their captivity <hi>[Babylon]</hi> and proceed to.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing, the place of their ſitting <hi>[by the waters] of Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hydrographers</hi> tell us, that the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Babylon</hi> flew out of Paradiſe.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Sin can turn the happy ſtreams of Paradiſe into the waters of <hi>Babylon;</hi> this turns the ſilver into tin, the wine into water, the <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful City</hi> it makes <hi>an harlot;</hi> and the
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:170357:109"/> 
               <hi>ſeates of judgement and juſtice,</hi> it fills with <hi>murtherers,</hi> Eſai. 1.21, 22. And when <hi>Bethel the houſe of bread,</hi> ſhall become <hi>Bethaven a den of thieves,</hi> how ſhall not <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> become <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſckecah, an homely and unpleaſant place?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Thoſe gracious ſtreams of the Waters of Life, that fertilize ſome ſouls into the happineſs of a Paradiſe, waſh others with their heavenly current; yet ſtill they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main a <hi>Babylon.</hi> Thoſe ſilver drops of Heaven, that falling on a good ſoil, fill the fields with fruitfulneſs; light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a clayiſh ground, it proves wet as well as cold, but barren ſtill. Some ſay the reaſon is, that the ſame Sun of Grace, which is (as it were) in the Meridian to ſome ſouls, is but (as it were) in the ſetting to the other: but thoſe ſay better, that the ſame fire that mollifies the wax, har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens the clay; not through want of efficacy in the one, but through the ill diſpoſition of the other. Chriſt <hi>ſtands at our doors and knocks,</hi> and <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers to us the waters of life without money, or without price:</hi> our rejecting ſo great
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170357:110"/> ſalvation, proves, that of our ſelves is our own deſtruction: <hi>I would have healed Babylon, and ſhe would not be healed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>[by the waters] of Babylon.</hi> Afflictions have been baptized by the name of [waters.] <hi>When thou paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſt through the waters, I will be with thee,</hi> (ſaith the Lord by his Prophet.) Here therefore they ſate, that by what they ſaw, they might, by refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting on themſelves, be induced to meditate on what they ſuffered. Yet it is obſervable, that they ſate but [by,] not [in] the waters; that as none could ſay with the juſtifying Hypocrite, This puniſhment is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er then we have deſerved; neither might any ſay with deſpairing <hi>Cain,</hi> This puniſhment is greater then we can ſuffer.</p>
            <p>God is juſt is puniſhing; yet in puniſhing is he merciful: though we have deſerved more then he inflicts, yet he inflicts leſſe then we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. He might make <hi>the deep wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters go even over our ſouls,</hi> as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they did cover the face of the new created earth; yet, as then <hi>his
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:170357:110"/> ſpirit moved upon the waters,</hi> (though as yet there was darkneſs upon the face of the deep) and anon did ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them into an heap, ſo as the dry ground appeared: ſo, though the inundations of our afflictions be deep and broad, and a thick darkneſs of Heavens diſpleaſure do cover us; yet even here doth his goodneſs move, and reſts not, but makes the ground of ſome ſparing mercy appear, from which our faith (as <hi>Noahs</hi> dove) may gather an Olive-branch of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, to keep us up, ſo as theſe deep waters drown us not, though they rage ſo horribly and ſo long, as <hi>by theſe waters of Babylon we ſit down and weep.</hi> And ſo I have done with the ſecond thing, the place of their ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, <hi>[by the waters] of Babylon;</hi> and proceed to</p>
            <p n="3">3. The third thing, their poſture in that place: <hi>[we ſate down.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Sitting is a poſture that implies a ſtay; yet was it neither deſire of eaſe, nor any content in the delightfulneſs of the place, that moved them to ſit. Things in nature do not more haſten to their centre in which they reſt,
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:170357:111"/> then did they long after <hi>Zion,</hi> after which their ſouls did breath: but a miſerable neceſſity under which they were bound, and that divine will to which they muſt ſubſcribe, had determined on them their ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years captivity, till the time of their return, <hi>Jerem.</hi> 25.12. and till then, though they might with tears have prevented that captivity; yet though they ſhould now, as <hi>Eſau</hi> for his bleſſing, beg deliverance <hi>care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully with tears,</hi> they ſhall neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs till then weep for that miſery, which (till they felt) they would not believe. That penitent ſorrow which would prevent the decree of ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance before it brings forth, is oft too late to reverſe it, when it is put in execution. Thoſe daily tears which (had they been ſhed at home) might have expiated their offences, and been in mercy accepted for their Countries ruine, are now condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to waſh a prophane land, where (hopeleſs Exiles) they are faſter bound by the decree of Heaven, then by all the power of their enemies. Their luſts had led them willing ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptives
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:170357:111"/> under the Law of ſin, and their enemies led them into an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing captivity under the power of ſinners; and as they had a long time ſinned without repentance, ſo ſhall they be a long time puniſhed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out remiſſion. The gliding ſtreams with happy freedom waſh the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral banks they paſſe by, and at length repoſe themſelves in the deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red common boſom of waters: but perpetuity gives perfection to theſe captives miſery; from day to day, from morning to evening, they [ſit down] in ſorrow, and tyre their weary ſouls in a longing expectation of long delayed felicity. <hi>The dayes of our age are but threeſcore years and ten; and though ſome be ſo ſtrong as to live fourſcore years, yet then is their ſtrength</hi> (naturally) <hi>but labour and ſorrow,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Moſes) ſo ſoon paſſeth it away, and we are gone,</hi> Pſalm 90.10. yet lo, ſeventy years, threeſcore years and ten, is the time for their ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptivity.</p>
            <p>Sin haſtens on, and lengthens to us the miſeries of our life. When God <hi>ſets our miſdeeds before him, and our
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:170357:112"/> ſecret ſins in the ſight of his countenance, our dayes we paſs in his anger, and our years in troubles; we conſume away in diſpleaſure, and tremble at his wrath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful indignation:</hi> we are killed from day to day; every dayes fear uſhers in a new trouble, and every dayes trouble brings forth a further fear: wave after wave, and billow after billow, come tumbling to our ſhores, whileſt we <hi>by theſe waters of Babylon ſit down and weep.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, ſecondly, if we refer their poſture to their affection, <hi>[we ſate down and wept;]</hi> thoſe poſtures of the body are to be uſed moſt, which ſuit beſt with the occaſion, and move, or (at leaſt) expreſs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward affection. <hi>Iſaac</hi> walked and meditated; old <hi>Jacob</hi> leaned upon his ſtaffe, and worſhipped: <hi>Abraham</hi> bowed his face to the ground, and did reverence: <hi>Solomon</hi> ſtood and prayed: <hi>Daniel</hi> kneeled upon his knees, to deprecate the captivity of his people: which here the people did bewail but ſitting. Standing ſuits not with a dejected condition; kneeling, not with a ſimple bewail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:170357:112"/> of our condition to our ſelves, but to God. <hi>Job</hi> indeed in his affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction aroſe and fell down, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he worſhipped. <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when he heard of the afflictions of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> ſate down and wept: <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar,</hi> when in the bitterneſs of her ſoul ſhe bewailed the death of her ſon, ſate down, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.16. and the Jewes when in the like ſorrow of heart, for the Temple, their own captivity, and the diſtreſſes of <hi>Zion,</hi> as if they would dwell and feed upon ſorrow, [ſate down:] <hi>we ſate down and wept.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Long afflictions require alike length of ſorrow to repentance. They are grievous ſins, that have provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked the God of mercy to lengthen the ſmart of his judgments: <hi>gravia pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cata, gravia deſiderant lamenta,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Iſidore</hi>) grievous ſins require the greatneſs of our ſorrow, both for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention and duration. But to be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued for ſin, and yet to be ſenceleſs of the judgement, is the worſt of judgments. No greater Symptome of death, then when the ſick man grows ſenceleſs, and knows not that
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:170357:113"/> he is ſick at all. And I would to God ſuch a <hi>Criſis</hi> could not be made of us; elſe, why ſuch wearineſs and neglect of our humiliation, whileſt the judgment is continued? Nay, (as if our ſores were the more feſtered for their lancing) why ſuch exemplary prophaneſs, as former ages have been piouſly ignorant of, and future (I hope) will deteſt to imitate? Why ſuch notorious ſins, ſuch noon-day evils, to which each mans eye and ear bears witneſs, perhaps ſome with tingling, others with tears? Why ſuch debauchedneſs of life, which when it hath unſouled the man, buries the beaſt in exceſs and riot? Why ſuch execrable oaths and blaſphemies, which paſs ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently through thoſe common ſhores, the fatal ports of our mouths, which are ſeldom open, but to tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſport ſuch carrion and filth? Why thoſe unworthy actions of luxury, that mark of reprobation; as one which engulphs the ſoul in ſuch baſe pleaſures, and makes it like the worſt of Devils, that are more groſs, (as the <hi>Caldean</hi> and <hi>Egyptian</hi>) that which
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170357:113"/> hath gluttony for the fuel, pride for the flame, unclean words for the ſparkles, infamy for ſmoak, ordure for aſhes, &amp; a hell for Centre? O de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive not your ſelves! all our longing expectation of the removal of theſe judgments, will be unſatisfied, till we heartily ſorrow, and earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent of thoſe our miſdoings, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we have provoked Gods wrath and indignation againſt us; there is no hope of our returning to the fair hill of <hi>Zion,</hi> the beauty of holineſs, and the beauty of order, till in ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for our tranſgreſſions, that have made a ſeparation betwixt God and us, <hi>by theſe waters of Babylon we ſit down and weep.</hi> And ſo I have done with the third thing, and come to</p>
            <p>The fourth thing, their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in that poſture, <hi>We ſate down [and wept].</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As all rivers, ſo thoſe of <hi>Babylon,</hi> run into the ſea; and as others, ſo they, receive addition of waters as they run. The heads of the drooping captives were as waters, and their eies as fountains of tears that ſtream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the rivers current: as they
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:170357:114"/> ſate down by them <hi>[and wept:]</hi> their whole compoſition was but like en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gendred clouds, exhaled vapours drawn up by the heat of Gods anger, and now diſtil and melt themſelves into continual ſhowers of tears. So as if <hi>Babylons</hi> rivers, as once <hi>Hagars</hi> bottle, ſhould chance to fail; as ſhe ſet her dying child, ſo have they their expiring mother before their eyes, which will force a new ſupply to fill them up again. And ſhould I ſay the waters tides were cauſed by the ebbes and flouds of the captives tears, it would be but an Hyperbole that would expreſſe the victors cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty, and the captives griefs. Nay their grief knows no ebb; their Moon (and ſo their ſorrow calls for a Change at laſt) is at her Full of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: each penſive enſlaved Jew payes to the waters of <hi>Babylon</hi> their tears for tribute, to the memory of <hi>Zion.</hi> And (as if what they ſhed for her ſake, they would commit to the waters of faithfulneſs to carry them) they ſit by the rivers ſide <hi>[and weep,]</hi> that their floating tears might at laſt greet their Country from her weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170357:114"/> worſhippers, whileſt they (mean while) weep again <hi>in remembrance of thee, O Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Etiam atque etiam flevimus,</hi> (ſay <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> and <hi>Tremellius) they wept, and they wept again.</hi> 1. As <hi>Patientes,</hi> Sufferers, they wept for themſelves, and for their children: <hi>Weep not for me, O ye daughters of Jeruſalem; but weep for your ſelves, and for your children:</hi> for <hi>your houſes ſhall be left unto you deſolate,</hi> Luk. 23.28. <hi>No affliction is joyous, but grievous.</hi> The preſence of dolorous and dreadful objects, even in minds moſt perfect, may as clouds over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſt all ſenſible joy, and diſſolve in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſhowres of tears. 2. As <hi>Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tientes,</hi> fellow-feeling members of others miſeries, <hi>[we wept again,] for thee, O Zion! Mine eye runneth with ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of waters, for the deſtruction of the daughter of my people: mine eye trickleth down, and ceaſeth not, without intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> Lam. 3.48. When Chriſt wept for <hi>Lazarus, behold how he loved him</hi> (ſaid the Jews:) theſe were teares, as of love of her good, ſo of compaſſion of her miſery.</p>
            <p>How ſhall that heart refrain from
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170357:115"/> tears, with whom love within, and miſery without, ſhall plead for pity? no expreſſion ſo emphatical, as that of weeping. Tears ſpeak that grief, which no tongue is able to expreſſe: no language ſo ſincere as this, nor yet ſo paſſionate. <hi>Alas, my brother,</hi> was the Elegy of that lying Prophet: his words might bely his diſſembled mourning; but tears are the Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick of grief, that ſpeak the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of a true hyperbole. And let who will, divide paſſions from the ſoul; let who will, ſay, fear becomes not a ſtout heart: it is a ſenceleſs heart that is not affected; and a ſtony heart that doth not weep. Nor is it any ſhame to confeſs that grief we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not conceal. Shall the hunted ſtagge pay a Funeral-Obſequie to his own fleeting life, which now ſits upon his utmoſt lips, with a frequent diſtilling tear? And ſhall not we, who are purſued with ſuch a pack of evils, weep for this, That he that is the ſoul of our ſoul, the breath of our noſtrils, the life of our <hi>Zion,</hi> the glory of our God, is at a diſtance from us? The Heavens weep dew
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170357:115"/> at the going down of the Sun: our Sun (I am afraid) is a ſetting at noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; our glory is departing; and ſhall not we weep? <hi>David</hi> the father, could weep like a child, at the loſs of a child; <hi>O Abſalom, Abſalom, my ſon Abſalom! would God I had died for thee; O Abſalom, my ſon, my ſon:</hi> And ſhall not thy children, O <hi>Zion,</hi> weep for the deſtruction of thee their mother, the Church? O daughter of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> what ſhall I liken unto thee? O Virgin <hi>Zion,</hi> wherewith ſhall I compare thee? our eye, our eye, runneth down with tears; we can as well dye for thee, as in this deny thee: <hi>By the waters of Babylon we ſate down and wept, when we remembred thee, O Zion.</hi> And ſo I have done with the fourth thing, their affection in that poſture, <hi>We ſate down [and wept;]</hi> and proceed to</p>
            <p>The laſt thing, the motive of that their affection: <hi>when we remembred thee, O Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Dura ſatis miſeris memoratio priſca bonorum:</hi> the memory of a loſt feli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, makes miſery it ſelf more miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable. There is more eaſe in ſenſe of
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170357:116"/> torment, then in loſſe of happineſs. To be in any captivity, is a calamity; but to be captive to the tyranny of an uncircumciſed people, whoſe ſportive paſtime was in their gaul<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing taunts of the afflicted, muſt needs heighten the affliction. <hi>Davids</hi> ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings made him complain; but the bitter reproaches he had from his foes, opened a ſpring of grief in him, which fed his tears day and night: yet the remembrance of his former (now loſt) happineſs in communion with God in his houſe, made yet deeper impreſſions in his ſoul, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 42.4. former favours and happineſs, make the ſoul more ſenſible of all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions to the contrary: <hi>we wept, [when we remembred thee, O Zion.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But what was <hi>Zion,</hi> that whileſt they remembered it, they could not forget to weep? Take it barely for their native countrey, (for ſo the word means in the latitude) and even ſo, <hi>Patriae fumus igne alieno luculen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tior:</hi> there is more pleaſant warmth in the ſmoak of our own, then in the fire of a ſtrange country: and then their loſs of happineſs, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170357:116"/> of miſery, muſt needs bee the more great, the one being a land of promiſe, the other of captivity; the one an effect of Gods favour, the other of his vengeance. But this is not all; <hi>the hill of Zion is a fair place; and the joy of the whole earth,</hi> Pſal. 48.2. Strictly taken, it was a fort in <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> on the top whereof was a Tower, called <hi>the City of David;</hi> and ſo by a <hi>Synechdoche, Zion</hi> is put for the Kingdom of <hi>Judea.</hi> Let us then remember what it was in its glory, and conſider what it is in its captivity, and refrain from weeping if we can.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Very excellent things are ſpoken of thee, O thou City of God.</hi> The <hi>Kings of the earth marvelled</hi> to ſee ſuch things: ſhall we (as <hi>David</hi> bids) <hi>go round about Zion; and tell the Towers thereof, and mark well her Bulwarks?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>There is the Throne of David:</hi> but <hi>(woe unto us that we have ſinned)</hi> the Casket is without its Jewel; <hi>David</hi> is not there on his Throne.</p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Tell the Towers thereof:</hi> The Towers were thoſe many Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and Noble Families; and the leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170357:117"/> Pinacles, the Heroick Gentry, who as they added a glory and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſo they were the ſtrength and defence of the King and his Throne.</p>
            <p>But all theſe Towers are either levelled with the duſt, or led into captivity, or have by an unworthy compliance baſely proſtituted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the power of the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Mark well her Bulwarks.</hi> The Bulwarks were the numerous commonalty, whoſe affections and loyal obedience were ſuch ſtrong for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications to the Throne of Majeſty, as the Kings of the earth have been afraid to aſſault them. But now all theſe ſtrong holds are broken down, the right hand of the enemy is ſet up, and all the adverſaries rejoyce: <hi>Zions</hi> Crown is caſt down to the ground, and her honour laid in the duſt, ſo as ſhe is become a ſcorn to her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; and they that hate her, ſhake their heads againſt her.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>Thither the tribes go up;</hi> but now they are taken captive.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, <hi>There is the ſeat of judgment;</hi> but now the chair of tyranny and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.</p>
            <pb n="215" facs="tcp:170357:117"/>
            <p>But ſecondly, <hi>Zion</hi> was called <hi>the Mount of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>the Holy Mount;</hi> and ſo it includes in it the Temple, the Church too; and of this God himſelf did ſay, <hi>This is my rest for ever, here will I dwell:</hi> yet, <hi>O God, the Heathen are come into thine inheritance, thy Holy Temple have they defiled;</hi> that beauty of holineſs is raviſh'd with Babyloniſh fire: That excellent work at whoſe rearing <hi>no noiſe of iron was heard,</hi> is broken down <hi>with axes and hammers:</hi> that Heavenly Order and Muſick, wherein God himſelf hath ſeemed to tread the meaſures, (for <hi>it's well ſeen, O God, how thou goeſt, how thou goest, how thou my God and King goest in the Sanctuary: the ſingers go be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the minſtrels follow after; in the midſt are the Damſels playing with their timbrels:</hi>) yet all this is hudled up in confuſion. That houſe of holy pleaſure wherein King <hi>David had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a door-keeper, then dwell in the glorious tents of ungodlineſs,</hi> is ſacked and ſpoiled; and the many thouſand veſſels of gold and ſilver, and the rich and hallowed veſtments of the houſe of God, are ſacrilegiouſly
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170357:118"/> carried away, and prophaned with revelling. When we think upon theſe things, we pour out our ſouls within us; for we were wont to go with the multitude into the houſe of joy, and praiſe; but now <hi>by theſe waters of Babylon we ſit down,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>But they were Babylonians that did this; Heathens, that had no knowledge of Gods Laws: but when men do <hi>Gentes agere ſub nomine Chriſti,</hi> mask Gentiliſme with the titles of Chriſtianity, acting works of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs under vizards of children of light; not carrying the children of <hi>Zion</hi> captive into <hi>Babylon,</hi> but turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Zion</hi> it ſelf into <hi>Babylon:</hi> this is enough to make us <hi>by theſe waters of Babylon ſit down and weep, when we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thee, O Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ezekiel</hi> took up a lamentation for wicked <hi>Tyre, Ezek.</hi> 27.2. <hi>Iſaiah</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wailed with <hi>the weeping of Jaazar the vine of Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heſhbon,</hi> Eſai. 16.9. and how ſhall not we take up a lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a bitter mourning, when we remember thee, O <hi>Zion? How
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170357:118"/> doth the City ſit almoſt ſolitary, that was full of people? ſhe that was Princeſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Provinces, how is ſhe become tributary?</hi> Lam. 1.1. <hi>How is the gold become dimme? how is the fine gold chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged? the children that did feed delicately, are almost deſolate in the ſtreets; and they that were brought up in ſcarlet, are ready to embrace dunghils,</hi> Lam. 4.5. <hi>hinc illae lachrymae:</hi> hence, hence are theſe <hi>rivers of tears which guſh out of our eyes,</hi> whileſt <hi>by the waters of Babylon we ſit down, and remember thee, O Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have now done with the parts of my Text, and you may expect I ſhould apply them; but I forbear: only from what hath been ſpoken, let us gather two things, as a double Corollary: one from them, as they were <hi>patientes,</hi> ſufferers; the other, as they were <hi>compatientes,</hi> fellow-feeling members of other ſufferings.</p>
            <p n="1">1. As they were <hi>Patientes,</hi> ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers. A Church may be brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to extream calamity: <hi>[By the waters of Babylon we ſate down.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. As <hi>Compatientes,</hi> as they were fellow-feeling members of others ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. We muſt be affected with
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170357:119"/> the calamities of the Church: <hi>we wept, when we remembred thee, O Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Of the firſt. A Church may be brought into deep miſery: <hi>by the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Babylon we ſate down.</hi> This Church of the Jews (for I deſire not to lead your thoughts into a further pilgrimage) though it had ſuch a magazine of bleſſings as no Nation or Church under Heaven was owner of; yet was it not exempt from this humane, nay Chriſtian lot of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery: in its very infancy (for in the Egyptian bondage it was but an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bryo not yet formed) but no ſooner did it take but its name, but it was chriſtned with the croſs: in <hi>Samuels</hi> dayes, God ſuffered himſelf (be it ſpoken with holy reverence) to be taken captive of the uncircumciſed Philiſtines; for the Ark, in which was his immediate preſence, was ſurpriſed and taken from the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, when the Church, no leſs then <hi>Phinehas</hi> ſon, firſt got the name of <hi>Icha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bod, where is the glory?</hi> 1 Sam. 4.19. In the dayes of <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> when ſhe was now in her perfect age and beauty, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was deſtroyed by fire, and
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170357:119"/> her children led captives into <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon:</hi> which ſad ſtory that ſorrowful Prophet hath expreſt in his patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal <hi>Lamentations,</hi> and our Pſalmiſt <hi>David</hi> here propheſied of. In her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crepit age, after the coming of Chriſt, <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was ſackt by <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaſian,</hi> and made quite deſolate; of which <hi>Daniel</hi> propheſied, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9. verſ. laſt. And our Saviour himſelf foretold, <hi>there ſhall not one ſtone be left upon another,</hi> Matth. 24.2. Nothing is left of it, but a name, and ruines that bear the impreſs of Gods ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance and juſtice. <hi>Where now are thoſe lying words wherein you truſted? the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord; this is the Temple of the Lord,</hi> Jer. 7.4. The Ark may be taken, the Temple may be deſtroyed, and ye may be carried captives into <hi>Babylon,</hi> where <hi>by the waters of Babylon ye may ſit down,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>And was God ſo ſevere to the <hi>na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural branches,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Appl.</note> which were diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, &amp; will he ſpare the <hi>wilde olive-branch</hi> that is grafted in? <hi>Behold, I bring evil upon the City that is called by my name; and ſhall you go unpuniſhed?</hi>
               <pb n="220" facs="tcp:170357:120"/> Jer. 25.9. What is become of thoſe renowned Churches of the Eaſt, mentioned in the <hi>Revelations,</hi> are they not quite deſtroyed? What is done to our neighbouring Churches in <hi>Germany,</hi> are they not miſerably defaced? Hath not God been work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſtrange work of juſtice alſo even upon us theſe many years, here in theſe three Nations, which though divided from the reſt of the world by Seas of waters, yet are conjoined in the ſame lot of calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? What will be the end, who can divine? but without ſpeedy and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious repentance, and amendment of life, may we not fear the like de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in which others have peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed? Therefore what was the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels adviſe to the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> it will be happy for us if we can make uſe of it: <hi>Remember from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do thy first works, or elſe I will come quickly, and remove the candleſtick out of its place, except thou repent,</hi> Rev. 2.5. And thus conſidering them as <hi>Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entes,</hi> ſufferers, you ſee that a Church may be brought into deep calamity:
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170357:120"/> 
               <hi>by the waters of Babylon we ſate down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly; As <hi>Compatientes,</hi> fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-feeling members of others ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings: we muſt be affected with the miſeries of the Church: <hi>we wept when we remembred thee, O Zion.</hi> Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is an act of humanity to any in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs. <hi>Did I not weep for him that was in trouble? was not my ſoul grieved for the poor?</hi> ſaith <hi>Job</hi> 3.25. but to the Church in evil times, compaſſion is a duty of piety: <hi>If I forget thee, O Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, let my right hand forget her cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning: if I remember thee not, O Zion, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth.</hi> It is a ſin that prophaneth the affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of nature it ſelf, to <hi>hide thy face from them of thine own fleſh;</hi> how much, that croſſeth the divinity of grace, to hide thy face from them of the ſame ſpirit? Our Saviour wept over languiſhing <hi>Jeruſalem: Daniel</hi> ſet his face to ſeek God in the capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, by prayers and ſupplications, and faſting, and ſack-cloath and aſhes: <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> when he heard of the afflictions of the people, ſate down and wept, and mourned, and faſted, and prayed before the God
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170357:121"/> of Heaven: and theſe devout Jews here, whom it pitied to ſee the glory of <hi>Zion</hi> laid in the duſt, <hi>wept when they remembred it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Appl.</note>What ſhall we ſay then of thoſe, who now in the time of our Church and Kingdoms calamity, when God ſeems to call to us as ſometimes <hi>Jehu</hi> did, <hi>Who is on my ſide, who?</hi> When the Church cries to us, as ſometimes ſhe did, <hi>Is it nothing to you, all ye that paſſe by the way? have ye no regard? be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and ſee, if ever ſorrow were like my ſorrow:</hi> yet neither in heed to his voice, nor in pity to her complaints, will they humble themſelves by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting and prayer, to cry to Heaven for mercy upon her; but rather when God calls to mourning, they are a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling: they <hi>drink wine in bowles, and anoint themſelves with precious oynt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but remember not the afflictions of Joſeph: wherefore I have ſworn by my ſelf (ſaith the Lord God of hosts) I abhor the excellency of Jacob,</hi> Amos 6.6, 8. And let ſuch read the 22 Chapter of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> verſ. 12, 13, 14. and tremble at the cloſe of it: <hi>Surely this iniquity ſhall not be purged from you, till you dye.</hi>
               <pb n="223" facs="tcp:170357:121"/> Ye would take it in foul diſgrace, to be called hard-hearted Jews; yet theſe were more compaſſionate of the Churches miſeries, then are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of you: theſe <hi>wept when they remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred Zion:</hi> How then ſhall not our hearts agonize under Gods diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and our bedewed cheeks trickle down with tears, for the miſeries of our Church and State; ſeeing the Heavens themſelves have with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh eyes long wept for our calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not with dews, but ſhowers of compaſſion, all the ſummer long; and ſtill (now in winter) keep their gloomy face, to reproove the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of our obdurate hearts, that can neither weep for our own, nor pity the miſeries of others. O inſenſate hearts! <hi>Is it nothing to you, that you all paſſe by Zions ſorrow wherewith the Lord hath afflicted her in the day of his fierce anger?</hi> The ſenceleſs creatures groan and travel, in a fellow-feeling pain; but you, when your own members ſuffer and periſh, O where are the <hi>ſounding of your bowels?</hi> are they quite reſtrained? The earth trembles at the voice of God, <hi>the Sea ſaw him, and
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170357:122"/> was afraid;</hi> and the rocks cleft at our Saviours paſſion: and ſhall men be ſo obdurate, as not to be moved, nor ſplit aſunder at a Church and a Kingdoms paſſion? If rocks be more affected then we, O God, take away from us theſe obdurate hearts of fleſh, and give us hearts of ſtone, that ſeeing we cannot with innocent, yet we may with hearts broken by repentance for all theſe ſins that have pulled down thoſe judgments upon our heads, <hi>by theſe waters of Babylon ſit down and weep, when we remember thee, O Zion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſo I have done with the words in their literal ſenſe, and proceed now to them,</p>
            <p>Secondly, in their moral ſenſe: of which briefly.</p>
            <p>In this ſenſe, St. <hi>Hilary,</hi> St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine, Hugo de Sancto Victore, Hugo Cardinalis,</hi> with many others, have taken theſe words: nor in this do we offer any violence to the truth of the hiſtory, but only digeſt <hi>geſta in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplum, &amp; ſcripta in doctrina</hi> (as ſaith St. <hi>Hilary</hi>) the paſſages into exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and Scripture into doctrine:</p>
            <pb n="225" facs="tcp:170357:122"/>
            <p>The ſoul (we all know) hath four ſeveral ſtates:
<list>
                  <item>1. Of innocence.</item>
                  <item>2. Of a lapſed condition.</item>
                  <item>3. Of renovation by grace.</item>
                  <item>4. Of expectation of glory.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>And going along with her from her firſt inſtant of creation, to the laſt of eternity, we ſhall find all of them in the Text.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That of innocence, but implied; ſo as that captivity ſuppoſeth a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going freedom: this freedom was that of our created holineſs, which we enjoyed in Paradiſe; that new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> that viſion of peace: but (God knows) we ſtay'd not long there, before we were carried captive by the devil into <hi>Babylon,</hi> from Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe into the world; from our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into exile, from liberty into ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, from glory into diſgrace, from pleaſure into grief, from hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs into miſery, from integrity into corruption, from life into death; and therefore <hi>Merito illic ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demus, merito flemus:</hi> there we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervedly ſit and weep (as <hi>Hugo Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinus</hi> concludes: and that is the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond ſtate.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="226" facs="tcp:170357:123"/>2. The ſouls lapſed condition fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gured in [<hi>Babylon,</hi> and <hi>the waters of Babylon.</hi>] That <hi>Babylon</hi> properly ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gnifies a City of confuſion; and that myſtically here is meant this ſinful world, is agreed on by a general ſuffrage of Fathers; and therefore conſonantly they make <hi>[the waters of Babylon]</hi> to be <hi>bona temporalia,</hi> (ſo <hi>Hugo Cardinalis</hi>) temporal things; which as the rivers, ſtay not, but paſs from one elbow of earth unto another; <hi>the world paſſeth away, and the luſts thereof,</hi> 1 Joh. 2.17. or (as <hi>Victori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> calls them) <hi>decurſiones noſtrae cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptiones,</hi> the decurſions of our cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption and mortality, which (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks) tend to the grave, as the rivers into the Sea: or (as ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine) flumina Babyloniae ſunt omnia quae hic amantur &amp; tranſeunt:</hi> the rivers of <hi>Babylon,</hi> are all tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory things whereon we ſet our hearts: (and ſo St. <hi>Hilarie) omnia ſae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culi &amp; corporalium opera;</hi> all ſecular and corporal travels, which like ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers are tranſient, without the leaſt ſtation: for what bodily pleaſure is it, but when once 'tis paſt, by that
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170357:123"/> time becomes none? What earthly joy, that dies not in the ſenſe, and periſhes not in the enjoying? yet are theſe thoſe rivers on which the heart of man ſets and faſtens his delight, and engulphs his care, till at laſt they drown his ſoul, and ſink it as low as that pit which knows no bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But not ſo the Saints, whoſe ſpiritualized ſouls are lifted up to a third ſtate of graces renovation; who though they do with patience, wait their deſired change in this fleſh of ſin, as well as of mortality: and ſo may be ſaid to <hi>[ſit by the waters of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon]</hi> which they account no better then the place of their ſhort captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet <hi>humiliatione humiliati,</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) they ſit in humiliation, (ſo <hi>Victorinus;</hi>) not erect by pride, nor caſt down by deſpair, but hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſet (ſo <hi>Hugo Cardinalis</hi>) becauſe they attend that miſery in which they are, that happineſs from which they are diſtant. Or, there they ſit, but 'tis <hi>(ſupra flumina)</hi> above the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, (ſo the old Latine word reads it.) The Citizens of <hi>Babylon</hi> ſo drench
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:170357:124"/> themſelves into the delights of the ſinful world, as they drown them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in their pleaſing, but deadly waters: whereas the Citizens of the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſit higher, ſit <hi>[above,]</hi> not ſo low, as to fear drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; nor ſo high, as not to need to <hi>[weep:]</hi> and <hi>[weep]</hi> they do too, as well as <hi>ſit:</hi> if <hi>ſitting</hi> be a poſture that pleaſeth the body; <hi>[weeping]</hi> I am ſure is an evacuation that eaſeth the ſoul. <hi>O quam fic flere juvat!</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Hierome,</hi>) O what ſweets are there in hallowed tears! how the ſoul delights to melt it ſelf into ſuch bleſſed ſhowers; becauſe when ſhe goeth into the loweſt pitch of mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe is then lifted up into the higheſt rapture of joy. You have heard of them that have wept for joy, but not ſo oft of them that have rejoyced for weeping; yet of all the paſſions the ſoul is owner of, ſhe is a debtor to none more for her joy then this; this is her rich treaſure, in which ſhe traffiques with Heaven; this the rareſt diſſolved pearl, with which ſhe defrayes all the paſſages of her captivity through the valley of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:170357:124"/> tears. Feel'ſt thou ſin? <hi>ſit down and weep:</hi> there is no innocence ſo clear among mortal men, as that which is drencht in tears. Fear'ſt thou hell? ſit down and weep: flames cannot burn, where theſe drops do fall. O happy weeping, that redeems from eternal weeping.</p>
            <p n="4">4. But lookeſt thou up to Heaven, that laſt ſtate of thy ſouls glory, her Country, her Kingdom, her Securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty? <hi>ſit down and weep,</hi> that thy <hi>Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage</hi> is prolonged, that <hi>mortality</hi> is not <hi>ſwallowed up of life,</hi> that thou art yet <hi>a ſtranger, and a ſojourner,</hi> nor art thou yet joyned with thoſe <hi>innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable companies of Angels,</hi> and <hi>the firſt born that are written in Heaven.</hi> O when ſhall that time be, when our ſouls being delivered from the <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> of this world, from the priſon of this fleſh, from the bondage of this corruption, ſhall be delivered into the glorious liberty of the ſons of God? How long Lord, till theſe ſouls of ours, which like ſtreams (here) wander from the fountain of bliſs, be again re-admitted into that glorious ſource of immortality? For
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170357:125"/> this we breathe, for this we groan, for this each devout heart weeps, when he recounts the miſeries of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent exile; but the happineſs of <hi>Zion</hi> which we expect, where all tears ſhall be wiped from our eyes; where is no death, nor ſorrow, nor lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation any more, but all joyes, tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quillity and peace, even for ever and ever.</p>
            <p>To which the God of mercy, for his Sons ſake, who is gone before us thither, in his due time bring us: to whom, with the holy and ever-bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Trinity, three Perſons, and one God, be all honour and glory, world without end.</p>
